# For this sample, I believe the source had a typo

# was changed to 'meng'.  (The source has frequent
# typos because it was generated on a manual typewriter).

# This is the only example I found that shows two VP joined
# to a make a sentence.  Also, this sentence uses 'nyin' and
# 'nyim' which I did find anywhere else in any of the resources.
# 
# I can only guess at two possibilities here:
# 1. The words 'nyin' and 'nyim' are part of the individual VP
#    and have nothing to do with the conjunction process.  In
#    this case, the conjunction is formed just by putting two
#    VP next to each other.
# 2. The two words are actually conjunctions.  If this is the
#    case then I would be very hesitant to form another sentence
#    from the example.  The other unusual word "ng'a" may or may
#    not be interacting with the conjunction words.
