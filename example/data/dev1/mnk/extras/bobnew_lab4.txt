Questionnaire
=============

This is a summary of the settings I chose on the grammar customization page.

Language:
   Mandinka
Features:
   none.
Word Order:
   SOV.
   Independent words for determiners.  No.  The o-suffix is attached to either the
   noun or one of its modifiers.
Sentential Negation:
   Adverb.
   I'm not sure how it is attached.  I am guessing it attaches to the VP.
   It comes before the verb.
Coordination:
   As noted in lab 3 write up, I didn't find any examples of NP coordination
   with more than two NPs.  The examples I did find are monosyndeton.

   The single example that I found of VP coordination is not well described.
   I am guessing that 'nyin' is a N-Polysyndeton coordinator.
Matrix Yes/No Questions:
   One form attested to is sentence final use of a question word, 'bang'.

Basic Lexicon:
   Noun 1.  wulu - dog
   Noun 2.  nankumoo - cat
   ITV. siinoo - sleep
   TV. bayindi - chase
   AUX.  noo - can.
      For this one, I am only guessing at the syntactic relationship between
      this aux and the rest of the sentence.

Test Sentences:
   With this vocabulary, I created two sentences:
     nankumoo siinoo = cat sleeps
     nankymoo nankumoo siinoo = cat chases cat

First Parses
============

I was able to parse 2 different senteces (one in LKB and one from the test suite).
Both of these sentences were contrived because the grammar does not yet handle
the -O suffix on nouns.

For example 'nankumoo siinoo' means '(the) cat sleeps'.  The stem form of this noun
is 'nankumu', although I never found any attested sources that showed this root form.
The inflected form 'nankumu-oo' is described as having a built in determiner.  However,
when adjectives or numerals are added to the noun, the -o suffix moves to the last
word of the NP.

Since I do not yet have a way to distinguish between a bare noun and a noun with the -o
suffix, I can't really parse a true sentence that includes a noun with the -o suffix.

In the test suite, I added 'wulu siinoo' which means 'dog sleeps'.  Here also, the
true form would have the -o suffix on the noun 'wuloo'  As far as I can tell, the
parse for this sentence is correct.

Coverage
========

As described above, the grammar is not correctly set up to handle the -o suffix on nouns.
This means that none of the nouns in the sentences will be identified with entries in the
lexicon.

So for now, I am parsing exactly one sentence by using a 'fake' noun.

It is not clear to me what the overgeneration window is trying to say.  The number in the
lower right corner (total overall coverage) is 0.0.

Needed Phenomena
================

As mentioned above, the noun phrases will not parse until the -o suffix is correctly
handled.  So except for 'fake' nouns, none of the sentences will parse.

Another item that would add a lot of sentences is pronouns.  Many of the sentences have
pronouns but not common nouns.  So adding pronouns would expand the coverage quite a bit.
