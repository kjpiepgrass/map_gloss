Changes to Grammar
==================
- I changed the determiners 'o' and 'olu' to use 'exist_q_rel'
  instead of '_indef_q_rel'.
- I added 'SPECI -' as a requirement for SPEC items in determiners.
  This kept the grammar from applying determiners to pronouns.
- I changed the definition of 'adjective-lex' based on the example
  from the English grammar.  This made translations of adjectives
  work.
- I removed tense markers from the Grammar.  They were not correctly
  implemeted in lab 8 and were causing redundant generations.


=================
English Sentences
=================

For the English grammar, I added a transfer rule to remove
the demonstrative determiner.  The Mandinka grammar does
not support these.

Dogs sleep
==========
This sentence has exactly one translation with the current
Mandinka grammar.

    wulu olu    siinoo
    dog  DET.PL sleep
    "The dogs sleep"
    
Dogs chase cars
===============
This sentence has exactly one translation with the current
Mandinka grammar.

    wulu olu    moto  olu    bayindi
    dogs DET.PL car   DET.PL chase
    "The dogs chase the cars"
    
I chase you.
============
This sentence was originally giving 48 readings in
Mandinka with the lab 8 grammar.  I made these changes
to reduce the number of readings:

- I changed determiners so they don't take pronouns in
  the SPEC.  This was achieved by adding [SPECI - ].
- I removed the tense marker lexicon entries that were
  part of lab 8.  Since in Lab 8 I didn't get to the
  point where the tense markers would only generate for
  the correct tense value, I have just removed them to
  reduce confusion.

Now, there are 3 readings for the sentence.  In Mandinka,
there are 3 different pronouns for 'you'. 'i' is singular,
and 'ali' and 'al' are plural.

    ng al  bayindi
    i  you chase
    "I chase you"

These Dogs Sleep
================
My mandinka grammar does not have a demonstrative determiner,
so i added a transfer rule to remove the 'proximal+dem_a_rel'
relation.  I made the rule required.

    wulu olu siinoo
    dog  DET.PL sleep
    "The dogs sleep"

Dogs Eat
========
This sentence does not translate to Mandinka with the current
Grammar.  In my grammar, I had implemented 'eat' as both a
transitive and intransitive verb, so the extra argument in the
MRS from English doesn't have a home in Mandinka.

I can eat glass
===============
This sentence does not translate into Mandinka using the current
grammar.  There is a problem with qeq linkages between the _eat_v_rel
and the _can_v_rel.  I wasn't able to figure out how to make it work.

    n weere o      domo noo
    I glass DET.SG eat  can
    "I can eat the glass"

It doesn't hurt me
==================
This sentence translates to one form in Mandinka.  When I saw it
work, I was astounded.

    a  buka ng baram
    it not  me hurt
    "it doesn't hurt me"

The Dogs chase cars
===================
This sentence translates to 4 different sentences in Mandinka
depending on the usage of 'o' or 'olu' which are singular
or plural determinters.

    wulu o      motu o      bayindi
    dog  DET.PL car  DET.PL chase
    "The dogs chase the cars"
    
I think that you know that dogs chase cars
==========================================
This sentence does not translate to Mandinka.  It runs out of
edges.

I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars
===========================================
No translation for this one.

Cats and dogs chase cars.
=========================
This sentence translates to 8 forms in Mandinka.  The variations
are from the user of singular or plural determiners for each of
the three NPs.

    nankumu olu    ning wulu olu    motu olu    bayindi
    cat     DET.PL and  dog  DET.PL car  DET.PL chase
    "Cats and dogs chase cars"
    
The english grammar generated 3 versions of this sentence.
There were Mandinka translations for only one of these.

dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs
===================================
I didn't try this sentence.  The Mandinka grammar does not
have any conjunctions for verb phrases.

Cats chase dogs and sleep
=========================
I didn't try this sentence.  The Mandinka grammar does not
have any conjunctions for verb phrases.

Do cats chase dogs?
===================
This sentence translates, but the result is incorrect.
The Mandinka grammar does not have a working solution
for question words.

Chase the dog
=============
The Mandinka grammar does not have a working solution
for imperatives.

Hungry Dogs eat
===============
This sentence does not generate to Mandinka for the same
reason that "Dogs eat" does not translate.

However, "Hungry dogs chase cars" does translate:

    wulu konkota o motu o bayindi
    dog  hungry  DET.SG car DET.SG chase
    "The hungry dog chases the car"
    
Hungry dogs eat quickly
=======================
This sentence does not generate to Mandinka for the same
reason that "Dogs eat" does not translate.
    
However, "hungry dogs chase cars quickly" does translate:

    wulu konkota olu    motu olu    bayindi katabake
    dog  hungry  DET.PL car  DET.PL chase   quickly
    "hungry dogs chase cars quickly"


=================
Italian Sentences
=================

For the Italian sentences, I added the following transfer
rules:
- Remove demonstrative determinters.  The Mandinka grammar doesn't
  support these.
- Change the make-harm construct to hurt.
- Insert pronouns.  There are two Italian sentences that don't have
  pronouns in the MRS.  Adding these transfer rules made the sentences
  work in Mandinka.

With these transfer rules, I was able to translate the following
sentences from Italian to Mandinka.

    Cani dorm-ono
    Cani insegu-ono macchine
    Ti-insegu-o
    Questi cani dorm-ono
    Cani mangi-ano
    Non mi-f-a male
    I cani insegu-ono macchine
    Cani e gatti insegu-ono macchine


Also since the Mandinka Grammar doesn't support 'eat' with
the optional argument, I tried these sentences to test
adjectives and adverbs.  These are equivalent to the two
extra sentences I tried in English.

    cani affamat-i insegu-ono machine
    cani affamat-i insegu-ono machine velocemente

The Italian sentences that do not translate to Mandinka essentially
do not do so for the same reason as the corresponding English sentences.

=======
Summary
=======

Of the test sentences, the Mandinka grammar translates:

English source: 7 translations
  Also 2 extra sentences that demonstrate adjectives and adverbs.
  
Italian source: 7 translations
  Also 2 extra sentences that demonstrate adjectives and adverbs.

In lab 8, there were 24 sentences from the test suite that parsed.
In lab 9, there are 20 sentences that parse.  The difference is
I removed the tense markers that were causing redundant outputs.

Also, I removed the lex entry for 'ko' (that).  This was an experiment
part way through the work that I did not undo.  It didn't affect the
translation results.  It just deleted one of the test suite parses.

There were no changes made to the test suite itself.
