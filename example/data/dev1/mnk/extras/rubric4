 For example 'nankumoo siinoo' means '(the) cat sleeps'.  The stem form
 of this noun is 'nankumu', although I never found any attested sources
 that showed this root form.  The inflected form 'nankumu-oo' is
 described as having a built in determiner.  However, when adjectives
 or numerals are added to the noun, the -o suffix moves to the last
 word of the NP.

I think you want to treat it as a clitic, which means segmenting
it off in your target representation.  That way it *is* an independent
determiner, and it appears after the noun (and any modifiers that
follow it).

 It is not clear to me what the overgeneration window is trying to say.
 The number in the lower right corner (total overall coverage) is 0.0.

How many of your ungrammatical examples parse.
