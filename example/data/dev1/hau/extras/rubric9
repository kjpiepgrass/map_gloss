 An example of a case-marker would be "yaaro yaa-syaa w maalmins
 littaafi", (the boy bought the teacher a book, where "w" is marking
 teacher "maalmins" as the indirect object).

This example doesn't parse :(

 I changed my head-opt-subject-phrase (which only functions with the
 sentence-final question marker) so that it would only take a main
 clause verb, or in other words a non-head-dtr with an inflected verb
 (not infinitive).

I assume you mean head-dtr, since head-opt-subj is a unary rule
(and therefor has no non-head-dtr).  I don't understand why this
rule is currently constraining the CASE of the subject, though. 
I think that constraint probably isn't having any effect.

 Now the CASE nom pronoun "I and the boy went to the market" (nii d
 yaaro mun-jee kasuwaa) will parse, but the CASE dat won't (min d
 yaaro mun-jee kasuwaa).

Nice :-)
