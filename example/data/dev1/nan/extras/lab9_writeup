Clean up
    First I fixed a few nagging bugs that you mentioned in writeup responses.
    Since I introduced adverbs, I was getting multiple parses when a
    stative verb modified a verb.  I constrained the SUBJ value of the item
    on the MOD list of the stative verb to be non-empty, so it no longer
    attaches to the whole sentence.
        kau2 chau2 kin2
        dog  run   fast
        'Dogs run fast.'

    I tried to fix the bad semantics with degree specifiers like
        chin1 kin2 e5 kau2 chau2
        very  fast LK dog  run
        'Very fast dogs run.'
    but I could not figure out the correct supertype to inherit from and I
    ran out of time.  I last looked at spr-plus-one-arg-lex-item (after
    searching matrix.tdl for 'degree'), but I didn't get it to work.

    I fixed the broken semantics on unspec_noun_rels generated by the
    bare-classifier-phrase rule, such as:
        chit4 chiah4 chiah8 niau1
        this  ANIMAL eat    cat
        'This (animal) eats cats.'
    I did this by tying the label of the unspec-noun-rel to the qeq on the
    HCONS instead of that on the quant-rel.

    I then fixed the broken indices for my demonstrative pronouns by linking
    the ARG0 of the pronoun_n_rel with the ARG1 of the demonstrative event
    relation.

    I planned on adding support for the group classifier kun5 and negative
    adverb m7 so I could parse all the MT sentences, but I ran out of time for
    this as well.

    While testing translations, I had to rename a few things, such as
    "pronoun_n_rel" to "_pronoun_n_rel".

Transfer rules instantiated
    I instantiated the pro-insert-arg1-mtr so I could get the argument on
    sentences like the Italian "ti-insegu-o" (which before only went to "jiok4",
    but now gets the proper "goa2 jiok4".

    After that, I needed to get the second argument, so I used 
    pro-insert-arg2-mtr.  After doing so, I got "goa2 jiok4 li2"

Further transfer rules developed
    I did not have time, but I would have needed to develop a rule that converts
    _quickly_r_rel to _quick_a_rel, since Taiwanese doesn't have adverbs in the
    same sense as Italian or English.  (I could have just renamed the relation
    of chin1 in my lexicon, but then it would have broke 'quick' if it were used
    as an adjective (even though that didn't exist in our sentences).

Coverage
    I did not count, but I think I got more than half of the sentences parsing
    for both Italian and English.

Why not full coverage
    The sentences that did not parse were the embedded clauses, one of the
    coordination sentences (although the other had two parses, one incorrect),
    the imperative, and "it doesn't hurt me".  Also, 'these dogs sleep" did not
    work because I was unable to implement "kun5" (see the "Clean up" section).
    There may have been some others that did not parse, or parsed but did not
    return the full sentence, but for the most part I was impressed with how
    much I was able to parse without changing very many things in the grammar.
