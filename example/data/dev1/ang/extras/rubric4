CASE
     I specified case-marking as nominative-accusative, where the
 affix used was specified as âunmarkedâ, for now.
 There were two reasons for this:

 1.The nominative-accusative case marking varies by gender, so there
 was no one affix that would be correct.

 2.In the nominative-accusative case for masculine and neuter nouns,
 the case is unmarked.  In the nominative case for feminine nouns, the
 noun is also unmarked.
     So, âunmarkedâ seemed the most generalizable designation.

But: You can say that nominative is unmarked, while accusative is
marked.  What do you mean by the "nominative-accusative" case?  Is it
that there is only a case distinction in feminine nouns?  Really?  It
would have been a better starting point to pick one such affix, and
then create more lexical rules.  You might still want to go back and
do this.  Then you can take a look at the grammar that you get out and
at least make reference to the rules it defines. If the case markers
are fused with the number markers (portmanteau morphemes), then you'll
want to make lexical rule types for case and number and then cross
classify them and have lexical rule instances for e.g., nom-sg etc.
If the form of each of those varies based on declension class, then
you add another dimension to your classification of rules, and
restrict each one to only the right class of nouns...

 MATRIX YES/NO QUESTIONS

	Since Old English doesn't have any question particles or  
 verbal inflection to mark questions, I think questions were mostly
 distinguished by prosody.  Similar to today, the word order for
 questions was VSO.  But in contrast to Modern English, Old English had
 a relatively free word order.  Because of this, the order VSO could
 also be used for statements.  Therefore, with no prosody information,
 the orthographic ? is maybe necessary in order to distinguis h
 questions from statements.  But that's not part of the ascii
 alphanumerics, so I suppose for now I'll just assume that, given a VSO
 sentence, that sentence is a question.  VSO statements will have to be
 dealt with later...

So VSO is more common for questions, but VSO statements are possible
and so are SVO questions?  That's interesting, and would be tricky
to model beyond just saying that all questions are marked by intonation
and both SVO and VSO are possible.  (Though if there is some identifiable
effect of VSO in statements, what we might really want is two separate
VSO constructions, one for statements and one for questions.)

	The verbs I chose were, in their root form,
 âsl@pâ; âsleepâ, and
 âlufiâ; âloveâ.  I chose their
 3rd-singular form, âsl@peTâ and
 âlufaTâ.  Unfortunately, the @ character didn't go
 over well, so I changed it to ae.  @ is supposed to represent the
 sound in âhatâ, and in Old English was identical to
 the phonetic character for that sound â a little ae combined.
 So I switched the character to ae.  Viewing my word list from tsdb()
 in emacs showed the words as slaep-et and luf-at.  So I guess capital
 letters are out, too?  Wait, they're only out for some thing.  Which
 thing?  I've now played around with adding them as th and T but I
 don't expand my coverage.  I'm going to keep them as
 âslaepeTâ and âlufaTâ.

(I think all those funny characters are smart quotes... can you
turn that off?)  My understanding is that the caps are all just
normalized, so that you're not going to lose coverage by using caps,
but you are going to have fewer distinction than you think you have.
That is, T and t will be treated the same.

	The auxiliary verb I chose was the verb
 âwillâ.  Auxiliary verbs act as independent
 predicates, so when âwillâ is used an auxiliary, it
 gets inflected for person and number, and the following verb appears
 uninflected.  I specified these forms as âslaepâ and
 âlufiâ.  Further, I specified that the auxiliary verb
 takes as its complement a VP, appearing before it and taking as
 subject an NP.

Actually, by "independent predicate" I mean semantically: Does
`will' introduce a semantic relation, or just contribute tense/aspect
information to the main verb's relation?

	Before I expanded my vocabulary, I got 0% coverage and 0%
 overgeneration.  After I expanded my vocabulary, I included words that
 I saw appearing the most often â pronouns, and some forms of
 the verbs.  But 0% coverage/overgeneration is still what I got.  I
 think this has something to do with how the words appear in emacs.
 Instead of âslaepeTâ, say, it is
 âslaep-etâ.  I don't want to go through and drop my
 capital letters if I don't have to.  I also don't quite understand
 whether this means that they have to be morpheme-separated in
 lexicon.tdl or not.  I have them both ways in the test-suite, although
 when doing make_item.pl I said I wanted them separated by morpheme
 boundaries, so maybe that's why?  

Right --- it's not the capital letter, it's the hyphen.  If you want
the morpheme segmented line, then you have to spell your lexical entries
(and affixes) so that they include those hyphens.  Otherwise, it won't
work!

 Does this mean I have to morpheme-separate them in lexicon.tdl?  But
 that dash isn't an ascii alphanumeric, so I don't want to add it like
 that to my lexicon...I'm really confused as to what can be capital,
 what can't, where, why, and how to incorporate the changes properly.
 But it is possible I just don't have any sentences that show this
 limited phenomena â again, determiners and nouns belong to
 different gender classes, inflecting different ways depending on
 number and case.  I've already spent 15 hours on this getting
 everything to run properly, though, so I'm assuming that 0% coverage
 and overgeneration is okay for now, until we can start getting a
 better grammar set up.

Yes, okay for now, but you should have been posting questions about
this to GoPost!! 

It's not the case that lexicon.tdl has to have only alphanumerics.
That is an overstatement of the constraints on what you can put in
to the customization script.  Inside the STEM value, hyphens and many
other non-alphanumerics (but not ' or ", I think) are fine.

 Still, it makes sentence parsing hard â if I'm inputting Ta
 but all I have written is Da, there will be no parses returned.
 Perhaps I should make a T = D rule.

Actually, I think you just need a couple of extra lexical entries:
Ta and Da with the same meaning, for example...

	And whether, given a noun, the determiner starts with a T or a
 D is beyond me and seems to switch around randomly.

Yes, that does just sound like free variation/unregularized spelling.

The instructions asked for exactly two tsdb profiles: you submitted
three.
