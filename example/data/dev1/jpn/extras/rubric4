# 42 this is an example of improper use of a demonstrative (wrong place)

mesi    wo  kono      ware  ga    eat-PRES
rice    ACC that-DEM  I     NOM   eat
`I eat that rice.'

Actually, I bet this is grammatical.  In modern Japanese at least,
you can say "この　私".

# 50 this is an example of an adjective separated by other elements (wrong place)

Likewise for this one.

# 66 this is an example of an adverb

涼風          さつさつ                 たり
ryofu        satsusatsu              tari
cool breeze  blow refreshingly-PAST  ADVERB
`A cool breeze blew refreshingly.'

Is there a verb in this example?  Is it in fact "たり"?  Based on what
I know of modern Japanese, さつさつ looks like an adverb, but I don't
see how you're getting "blow refreshingly" out of it.  From what you
say below, it seems like たり is a copula or auxiliary verb, and that's
what's being modified by さつさつ.  Can you find examples where there
is (also) a content verb in the sentence?

You should construct some simpler examples of embedded clauses,
based on the descriptions in your sources.  What form does the embedded
verb take?  Are there any other constraints?  Also, you could construct
ungrammatical examples by putting the と at the beginning of the clause
instead of the end, putting in multiple とs, etc.

# 59 this is an example of a non-verbal predicate (non-copular adjective)

心      も   静かなら    ず
kokoro  mo  shizukara  zu
heart   ?   quiet      NEG
`The heart is unsettled.'

You'll need to figure out what　も is or (probably better) replace
it with an appropriate case marker to make these examples usable.

# 63 this is an example of a non-verbal predicate (locative copular)

江戸  なる     寺     に        参り      たり
Edo  naru   tera   ni        mawiri   tari
Edo  COPULA temple LOCATION  go-PAST  RESULTATIVE
`I went to a temple in Edo.'

The trouble here is that that locative is serving as a modifier
instead of a predicate (some kind of relative clause, probably).
What you need is something liek "The temple is in Edo."

  However, I do know that it is wrong in one case. For the verb たべる,
  I originally only had the inflection change for this one verb. But,
  its verb class - shimo-nidan - actually has another verb that
  conjugates in a different way, because it doesn't end with the same
  character. When I added this additional conjugation, that introduced
  more ambiguity. Without the additional conjugation, I was getting
  only 4 readings for the example mentioned before, instead of 16.

You should always include IGT in these cases so I can test things
out and give better feedback.  This sounds like a case where what
you need are extra subrules in the irule definition, but I can't tell
without looking at examples.  I also see that in your grammar as turned
in you still have subrules with "" in them, instead of *. Have you fixed this?

  It appears that literally none of my test items I added this week
  have any readings. This isn't too surprising though, as many involve
  words that haven't entered the lexicon - adjectives and adverbs. And
  examples that use words contained in the lexicon are portraying
  phenomena that haven't been modeled yet.

Right ... this is expected.

Regarding ambiguity, it seems that you haven't fixed the case problem
that I noted last week.  From your classical-japanese.tdl file:

yodan-itv-verb-lex := yodan-rule-dtr & intransitive-verb-lex.

yodan-tv-verb-lex := yodan-rule-dtr & transitive-verb-lex.

intransitive-verb-lex := main-verb-lex & intransitive-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < >,
    ARG-ST.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np ].

transitive-verb-lex := main-verb-lex & transitive-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < #comps >,
    ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np ],
             #comps &
             [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                 COMPS < > ],
                           HEAD +np ] ] > ].

nom-intransitive-verb-lex := intransitive-verb-lex &
  [ ARG-ST.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np &
                                [ CASE nom ] ].

nom-acc-transitive-verb-lex := transitive-verb-lex &
  [ ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np &
                              [ CASE nom ] ],
             [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD adp &
                              [ CASE acc ] ] > ].

If your lexical entries don't inherit from nom-intransitive-verb-lex
or nom-acc-transitive verb lex, you don't really have a case system.
That's why you're getting two parses of this example:
