1) Documentation the new or revised choices you made in the customization system, illustrated with examples from your test suite.

My changes to the customization system this week aren't grammar related, but additions to the lexicon. I have added some more nouns: common nouns - 物 (thing), 学正(student), 心(heart), 寺(temple), 涼風(cool breeze). I found the kanji character for the first person pronoun - 我. I also added a couple of verbs: おぼしめし (an honorific transtive verb meaning `to think'), and 参る (to go). I am not so sure about which verb type 参る should go under at the moment. And I still need to add a new conjugation type for honorific verbs to get おぼしめし to work.

The reason why I've added these entries to the lexicon was because I had many new examples in my test suite that required these words. I found most of my examples from references, and wanted to keep them in their original form.

I did make one non-trivial change to the lexicon - the addition of an auxiliary negation verb. I have already described the treatment of sentential negation in Classical Japanese in the last lab, so I will not repeat myself. As already noted, the negation page in the customization system doesn't allow for auxiliary negation, because it is possible to do that separately in the lexicon. So, I added the auxiliary - ず - which is used in the following examples:

2) Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or the customization system.

Most of this week's work was adding examples to my test suite and not providing analysis in the grammar, so I was primarily adding items that do not parse.

_Argument Optionality_

Classical Japanese allows you to drop subjects, objects, and even entire predicates. Because of this, my references mention that a reader must always keep in mind how one might fill these spots based off of context. I have included examples where the subject is missing, and where the object of a verb is missing.

_Demonstratives_

Demonstratives in Classical Japanese seem to be handled by using demonstrative pronouns (e.g., こ, それ, かれ, いづれ) with an attributive suffix particle (e.g., の).

I have one grammatical example here, where we have a demonstrative functioning as a determiner. My ungrammatical examples are variations of where to place the demonstrative, and removing the suffix particle (resulting in a demonstrative pronoun).

_Definiteness_

As far as I can tell, Classical Japanese doesn't have a direct way of indicating definiteness.

_Attributive Adjectives_

In Classical Japanese, there seem to be three types of adjectives: (1) adjectives in the ordinary sense - inflected autonomous words, (2) adjectival verbs, and (3) verbs that have been conjugated into the attributive (rentaikei) form.

Examples:

(1) うれしき    物
      ureshiki   mono
      pleasing  things
      `Pleasing things.'

(2) 静かなる         暁
    shizuka-naru  akatsuki
    quiet         dawn
    'A quiet dawn.'

(3) 死ぬ                  人
     sinu              hito
     die-ATTRIBUTIVE   person
     'One who dies.'

As you have advised, I am only going to look at type (1) adjectives. These adjectives are "inflected autonomous words that describe a condition or an ongoing state." (Shirane, 2005)

`I see pleasing things.'

_Adverbs_

Adverbs in Japanese are really just adjectives or adjectival verbs that appear in their (inflected) ren'yokei form. The types of adverbs we are looking at, manner adverbs, seem to be handled with the たり and なり adjectival (auxiliary) verbs (yet another source of ambiguity with たり!!). These forms are basically an adjective followed by the auxiliaries たり or なり.

There are adverbial particles, which, "generally indicate quantity, degree, limit or scope. Their primary functions are analogy, restriction, minimal desire, addition, scope, degree, approximation, example, and emphasis." (Shirane, 2005) As these are not `manner adverbs,' I will not analyze these.

_Embedded Clauses_

It was really hard for me to find examples about embedded clauses. I have only found examples of embedded declarative clauses, and they are quite long and involve some pro-dropping. Embedded clauses are indicted with the と particle. This particle is described as being, "used to indicate that the preceding is the content of the action following the verb, such as (to think), (to say), (to hear), or (to do), thus indicating the content of thought, speech, hearing, or action. Often takes the form of a citation, indicating the content of a poem, letter, or message." (Shirane, 2005)

I couldn't find any examples of emedded interrogative clauses. However, I have _another_ source that will arrive sometime very soon that I hope might have one of these. My source I received this week "Classical Japanese Grammar Illustrated With Texts" is not so good, because it doesn't have much English explanations in it. It assumes that the reader fully understands modern Japanese.

The following examples actually use a special honorific verb, おぼしめす, that means "to think."

Her Highness  LOCATION  ALSO  that long     SUBJECT  cannot last  think-PAST   RESULTATIVE
`Even when it came to Her Highness, Her Highness thought, "(the hill of snow) cannot last that long (without melting)."

_Non-Verbal Predicates_

"なり and たり are copular auxiliary verbs in which the speaker or writer makes an assertion or declaration, usually identifying the subject in an X=Y sentence structure, with Y being a nominal." (Shirane, 2005) While both なり and たり can indicate a declaration, only なり can declare the location of an object. Note that this is another source of ambiguity with たり!

It seems that we can declare things about noun phrases, such as defining their state or location, with a copula. But, adjectives (e.g., "This dog is small") are handled without a copula.

Items 63-65 demonstrate declaration of the location of an object. However, it is not in a form simliar to "The cat is in the park." like you wanted, but the object of the sentence has its location declared. I hope these will be sufficient. If not, I can just keep digging.

3) Documentation the coverage of your grammar over the testsuite.

The amount of ambiguity has been drastically reduced in my grammar. One of my coordination examples used to have 64 readings, now it only has 16. I think this can be attributed to my new verbal inflection morphology updates. I am no longer allowing the base form of verbs to blindly pass straight through lexical rules without any change to morphology. Now, it will inflect it properly, so I won't get 6 copies for each verb, because there are 6 morphemes for each inflection. It should only produce the morphologically correct conjugations. However, I do know that it is wrong in one case. For the verb たべる, I originally only had the inflection change for this one verb. But, its verb class - shimo-nidan - actually has another verb that conjugates in a different way, because it doesn't end with the same character. When I added this additional conjugation, that introduced more ambiguity. Without the additional conjugation, I was getting only 4 readings for the example mentioned before, instead of 16.

In addition, there are several other, particularly my examples of aspect, that have reduced ambiguity. One of my aspect examples used to have 12 readings, now it only has 2. I think this is attributed to the fix to the ASPECT heirarchy that I made this week, which I describe below.

My addition of the negative auxiliary seems to be working properly. My grammatical example has a parse, and my ungrammaticals don't. The MRS looks correct as well.


It appears that literally none of my test items I added this week have any readings. This isn't too surprising though, as many involve words that haven't entered the lexicon - adjectives and adverbs. And examples that use words contained in the lexicon are portraying phenomena that haven't been modeled yet.

4) Documentation of any changes you made to your grammar to improve its performance (coverage and accuracy).

_Aspect Changes in Customization System_

In Classical Japanese, り and たり are auxiliary verbs that are ambiguous between resultative and continuative aspect. I have added a new supertype - "resultative_continuative," and allowed these two auxiliaries to both contribute [ASPECT resultative_continuative] to their verbal complements. I also removed all of the predicates for my auxiliaries (besides the negation auxiliary), and just had the auxiliaries require their complement verbs to have TENSE/ASPECT features contributed by the auxiliaries. 

Here are the examples where I use these auxiliaries (also presented in Lab 3):

_Verbal Inflections_

I have modified irules.tdl to allow the verbs of different classes to conjugate for their various forms. I am not using most of these at the moment. In fact, items 1-42 were completely covered already with the minimal entries in irules.tdl I had last week. However, I now have a very wide coverage of inflectional changes. Some verb types allow for verbs of base forms with different endings - e.g., る, ず, く, etc. However, most of my lexical rules only cover one of these changes. When (if) I add more verbal stems to my lexicon, I will have to add more entries to my irules.tdl to cover the conjugations. This will be trivial though, because the conjugation will follow the same pattern, except it will be, for example, endings beginning with the `r' sound instead of the `s' sound. I didn't want to add all possible conjugations right now, because some verb types do not allow certain endings. For example, all irregular verbs only allow one type of ending, so these are actually completely covered. But, the four regular conjugations can potentially allow verbs with different endings, but I don't want to add them until I have found verbs that require them and included them in my testsuite.
