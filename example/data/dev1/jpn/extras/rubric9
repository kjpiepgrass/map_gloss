Notes:


The last thing I had to do in order to fix translation from Classical
Japanese -> Classical Japanese (i.e. generation) was a hack that made
both my question inflection and negation inflection lexical rules
contribute [TENSE present]. The thing I found that was because all of
my inflected forms were contributing TENSE values that were not leaves
in the heirarchy - i.e. they were non_past or non_future - the MRSs
were underspecified for TENSE. This would allow any tense auxiliaries
to attach to the sentence, because they were underspecified for
tense. The reason why I made a hack to have all questions and
negations be [TENSE present] was that the negation auxiliary follows a
special conjugation, and that the question inflection is being
modelled in a slightly inaccurate way. By that, I mean that the
question particle isn't really an affix, so it shouldn't have it's own
inflection. I now realize that this means that it should propagate up
the verb it is modifying's TENSE value, but it is the 11th hour and I
don't want to be fiddling with the grammar at this point to correct
something that works for our purposes.

... Indeed, this doesn't seem to be the right way to go about
fixing this.  The question marker can't co-occur with non-present?

 For Italian, I instantiated the following transfer rules:
 Again, I needed this one so that we allow pro-drop:
 pro-drop := pronoun-delete-mtr.

Really?  Italian is pro-drop too.

  I have complete coverage in Italian. The only problem is that I have
  a bit of overgeneration with "I think that you know that dogs chase
  cars." and "Dogs eat quickly." There is overgeneration with "I think
  that you know that dogs chase cars." because of the pro-drop
  rules. By that, I mean that since we delete "I" and "you" we are
  left with possibilities like "The dog knows that someone knows that
  someone chases cars." and "Someone knows that the dog knows that
  someone chases cars."

I'm not sure this is overgeneration.  Japanese doesn't mark PNG
with prodrop...

  In English, I can translate everything besides "Cats chase dogs and
  sleep." I find this fact quite perplexing, as I can translate this
  from Italian.

That's because it's S-coordination in Italian but VP-coordination
in English.
