-------------------------------------------------------

Subject-verb inversion would have also been a good choice, but it requires the 'li' particle after the verb, and so was not a complete match. This is one more area we will need to  further customize  manually.

EB> This seems like a cognate of the Russian question clitic
(also "li", I believe).  In Russian, "li" goes in second position,
but it doesn't have to be the verb that is first.  Is that true
in hbs too?

A coordinated noun phrase acting as a subject requires the verb to agree with PL. Gender agreement rules are interesting: if the coordinated group is all Fem, the verb takes on Fem ending; if the group is all Neut, the verb is Neut; otherwise the verb is Masc by default.

EB> This is fairly typical of coordination in IE languages, and
quite modelable, but somewhat painful to do ... you have to make
different subtypes of the coordination rules for:

all conjuncts feminine
all conjuncts neuter
first conjunct masculine
second conjunct masculine

... you can get into this if you like, or just choose to leave
the gender on the mother underspecified and let the grammar overgenerate
in this respect.

NPs, adjectives, and PPs can be predicates in hbs. A copular is required for NP predicate, but not the others.
The copular varies in person and number, agreeing with the subject.  

EB> "Copular" is an adjective, as in "copular construction".  The noun
you are looking for is "copula".

NP and adjective predicates can either be nom or gen case.

EB> Is there a difference in intepretation between the two?

Of the covered sentences, many tree structures are incorrect where the subject and object are in the wrong positions. That is,
the subject is the complement of V while the object is in the specifer of S. In order to fix this we need to revise our head-comp to require
a non-nominative case for its object and our head-subj to require nominative case for its subject.

EB> You don't want to have the rules doing this --- it should be
in the lexical entries.  When you report problems like this, please
include specific examples so that I can test them out and provide
specific feedback. Looking quickly at your choices file, the verb
class definitions look okay.  Please send me an example and we can
debug in class on Wednesday.

There were two cases of ungrammatical examples having parses. One for negation and two for pro drop. For negation, example 50, NEG ne
is sentence-intial where it should be adjacent to vidi.
Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {neg}
ne Slavko vidi  Olgu
ne Slavk-o vid-i  Olg-u
NEG Slavko-M.SG.NOM see-3.SG Olga.F-SG.ACC
'Slavko does see not Olga.'

EB> This is a bug in the negation library --- I'll pass the
info on to Joshua.  Meanwhile, I think you can fix it by
requiring [SUBJ cons] on the MOD of the negative adverb.

There is a missing object that is required by the verb. This can fixed with a rule that requires a verb to have a certain number 
of arguments in its ARG-ST.

EB> This is because you haven't specified that the argument
is required.  You need to add [OPT -] on the object to the
verb class containing vid.

EB> I tried parsing your "da li" question examples, and "da li" wasn't
getting an analysis.  I need to look into why, and will try to post
to Go Post soon.

EB> Your coordination analysis ran into a bug in the customization system.
You should replace entries in the lexicon like this:

i := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "i" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "1" & "2" & "3" ].

With sets of entries like this:

i-1 := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "i" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "1" ].

i-2 := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "i" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "2" ].

i-3 := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "i" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "3" ].
