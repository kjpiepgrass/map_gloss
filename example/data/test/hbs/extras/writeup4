There are 3 major ways to ask Yes-No questions. Declarative sentences marked by intonation alone can form a yes-no question:

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Slavko vidi Olgu?
Slavk-o vid-i Olg-u ?
see-1.SG.PRS see-3.SG.PRS Olga.F-SG.ACC ?
'Does Slavko see Olga?'

Enclitic particle 'li' is another way to form a yes-no question. The finite verb (auxiliary if there is one, otherwise the main verb) precedes li immediately and is thus sentence-initial:

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Vidi li Slavko Olgu?
vid-i li Slavk-o Olg-u ?
see-1.SG.PRS li.Q Slavko-M.SG.NOM Olga.F-SG.ACC ?
'Does Slavko see Olga?'

Note that an enclitic finite verb is replaced in yes-no questions formed with 'li' by its non-enclitic (full) form. See in the example below, hoce is used instead of ce:

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q, tam}
Hoce li Slavko vidjeti Olgu?
hoc-e li Slavk-o vidje-ti Olg-u ?
AUX.FUT-3.SG li.Q Slavko-M.SG.NOM see-INF Olga.F-SG.ACC ?
'Will Slavko see Olga?'

A third way to form yes-no questions is by using sentence-initial sequence 'Da li', which may be regarded as the full form of li, gets the enclitic form od the AUX right after it, and does not constrain the order of the remaining elements:

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Da li ce Slavko vidjeti Olgu?
da li c-e Slavk-o vidje-ti Olg-u ?
da.Q li.Q AUX.FUT.3.SG Slavko-M.SG.NOM see-INF Olga.F-SG.ACC ?
'Will Slavko see Olga?'

As one can see, yes-no questions in hbs allow a lot of variation and have not been an easy fit for the grammar matrix. For this grammar iteration, we have selected  the sentence-initial separate question particle spelled 'da li' (it's actually two particles, but the customization system allowed a space in between).

Subject-verb inversion would have also been a good choice, but it requires the 'li' particle after the verb, and so was not a complete match. This is one more area we will need to  further customize  manually.


COORDINATION

Hbs is tolerating a variety of coordination strategy - mono-, poly- and omnisyndeton for nouns, NPs, VPs and entire clauses. The most typical coordination marker is the word "i". A few illustrations below:

# Two-noun coordinated subj; predicate agreement with PL

A coordinated noun phrase acting as a subject requires the verb to agree with PL. Gender agreement rules are interesting: if the coordinated group is all Fem, the verb takes on Fem ending; if the group is all Neut, the verb is Neut; otherwise the verb is Masc by default.

We have also included an example of coordinated clauses with the marker "a", which has the semantics of a mild contrast:

'Slavko is sleeping and(while) Olga is reading'

ATTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES

Attributive adjectives usually precede the nouns and agree with them in gender, number and case.
Some exceptions include terms of endearment with the attribute possessive pronouns, like 'ruža moja' (my rose) - we have not modeled those at this time.
We will only model the Adj preceding the noun pattern, including the following examples:

# Attributive adjective - agreement

'Maria is drinking green tea'

ADVERBS
Two of our sources were noting that single-word adverbs modifying a verb *tend* to precede it,
but may sometimes follow it. It is not clear when exactly adverbs are allowed to follow Vs they modify.
We are including the examples in the test suite of grammatical adverb constructions quoted in our source materials (or trivially derived from those):

# Adverbs - preceding a transitive verb.

We are not sure if the following examples are acceptable:
# ? Slavko vidi jasno Olgu.
# ? Slavko vidi Olgu jasno.

This is something we should vet with a native speaker.

EMBEDDED CLAUSES
                                                                     
Embedded clauses are marked with the complementizer 'da'. Some verbs can either take both declarative and interrogative, while other verbs
can only take one or the other. Embedded questions must be marked with a clause-initial 'da li'. The verb 'know' can embed both types of clauses while 'ask' can only embed questions and 'think' can only embed statements. The examples below illustate these points:

NON-VERBAL PREDICATES

NPs, adjectives, and PPs can be predicates in hbs. A copular is required for NP predicate, but not the others.
The copular varies in person and number, agreeing with the subject.

INFORMATION STRUCTURE

hbs' information structure is captured by word order and prosody. The focus of a sentence is sentence-final.

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo, c,info} 
Slavko Olgu vidi
Slavk-o Olg-u vid-i
Slavko.M-SG.NOM Olga.F-SG.ACC see-3.SG
'Slavko sees Olga.'

The answer to a wh-question is also sentence-final. For example, the answer to 'tko vidi Olgu?' 'who sees Olga.' is:

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo, c}
Olgu vidi Slavko
Olg-u vid-i Slavk-o
Olga.F-SG.ACC see-3.SG Slavko.M-SG.NOM
'Slavko sees Olga.'

Focus can also be marked with 'to' in the cleft construction:

#cleft

Vetted: s

to Slavk-o vid-i Olg-u
that Slavo-3.M.SG.NOM see-3.SG Olg-3.F.SG.ACC
'It was Slavko who sees Olgu.'

The topic of a sentence is sentence-initial. For example, if Olga is the focus of  'Slavko vidi Olgu.' then the topicalized element is put first in the following sentence: 

Source: a
Vetted: s
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {info}
Olgu vidimo i mi
Olg-u vid-imo i mi
Olg.F-3.SG.ACC see-1.PL AND 1.PL.NOM
'We too see Olga.'


TEST COVERAGE

We have 34% coverage. About 20+ uncovered positive examples come from the agreement section where adjectives are used, which were not
covered by the customization system.

Of the covered sentences, many tree structures are incorrect where the subject and object are in the wrong positions. That is,
the subject is the complement of V while the object is in the specifer of S. In order to fix this we need to revise our head-comp to require
a non-nominative case for its object and our head-subj to require nominative case for its subject.

A lot of the grammatical examples that don't have parses are the result of errors in test suite or the lexicon. For example, in some sentences we need to
change slavko to slavk-o in the morpheme gloss. We also need fine tune our lexicon and inflection rules to account for irregularities.
For example there were no lexical entries for nju, tebe, spa-vam, and spa-vate.

There were two cases of ungrammatical examples having parses. One for negation and two for pro drop. For negation, example 50, NEG ne
is sentence-intial where it should be adjacent to vidi.

There is a missing object that is required by the verb. This can fixed with a rule that requires a verb to have a certain number 
of arguments in its ARG-ST.

Overall, a lot of uncovered grammatical examples come from errors in our lexicon and inflection rules.
