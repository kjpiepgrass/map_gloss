Case
Czech is a nominative-accusative language, indicated by a suffix change.  It asks what the suffix is used for those cases.  The thing is, Czech has fusional morphology, so it's really irregular (57 declension paradigms).  So I just used the suffixes for my most common noun, but I don't think it generalizes to any other noun in my lexicon.  I'm planning on throwing lexical entries at it to handle the irregularity, though maybe I'll think otherwise once I start doing the work.  I guess my other option is work with the "higher-level tape" and accept morpheme-glossed input.  I just feel like it'd be "cooler", when I'm done, to be able to input text just as a speaker would do, and have it work.  I'm trying to maintain all the diacritics (at the cost of dealing with Unicode) for the same reason.

Word order
I chose SVO, which is mostly true (word order is somewhat free, but variations usually reflect pragmatic intent).  I chose no determiners, since I think I can treat possessives and demonstratives as adjectives.

Sentential Negation
Negation is accomplished through prefix on the verb.  It can occur on any verb, and it's always spelled ne-.  Easy.

Coordination
This is the one I was least confident about.  I said that Czech is polysyndeton, but I haven't found any examples of coordinating more than two things.  Writing this reminds me, I should email my native speaker and ask her how you do 3+ co-ordination.  Anyway, Czech has one 'and' conjunction for NPs, and one for sentences.  I said that it comes after the coordinand, but after what you said in class, maybe I should say it comes before.  If I have A and B, B is the coordinand, not A, right?

Matrix Yes/No Questions
This is easy: it's just subject-verb inversion, applicable to any verb.

* Document what happened when you tried parsing a sentence with your starter grammar.
My first sentence (which is about as simple as it gets: NP VP) didn't parse, although it came close: the lkb found some constituents, but no initial symbol.  Turns out this was due to a misformed morphology rule (I think).  The customization system required that I enter a noun ending for nominiative and accusative declensions.  So I chose endings for my most common noun (ptak).  So I said that the nominative ending was "-ak" and the accusative ending was "-aka" (which is true, for that one word).  But then I entered the orthographic form as "ptak", so I guess the lkb never recongnized it.  If I changed my lexicon.tdl entry to "pt", it worked.  The actual structure was strange: the tree has two non-branching rules to get to the noun.  From noun-lex to nom-noun to bare-np.

* Document the current coverage/overgeneration of your grammar on your test suite, per [incr tsdb()], before and after you expanded the vocabulary
However, I got 0% coverage in tsdb.  What I eventually realized (after some hints on GoPost) was that my item file has characters with diacritics, and my lexicon.tdl (mostly) doesn't.  So when I type words directly into lkb, I forgo the diacritics (because I don't know how to enter them), so it works.  But the words in my item file never match up with the words in the lexicon.

I was hoping this would be easy to fix by just changing the lexicon, but the only reason the first sentence parsed in the first place was that I changed my entry for "ptak" to "pt" so that the nominal rule would add an "ak" to make it match. In retrospect, I should have skipped the part of the customization script that asked me what affixes to add to my nouns to decline them.

* Discuss which phenomena will give you the biggest bang for the buck in terms of improving coverage / overgeneration over your test suite
So removing the affix system for case is the first thing I have to fix.  I would like to maintain the two-case distinction (three if I get around to handling dative), but would rather just have lots of lexical entries, rather than have irules that try to generate them, because Czech morphology is so random.

Since I'm getting zero parses now, it's hard to tell what I should fix next.  I guess one obvious pieces of low-hanging fruit would be case, because it's hard to write a Czech sentence without running into it.  Almost all my examples have it, even when I'm not intending to illustrate it.  Once I get noun case working, I suppose case agreement with adjectives and possessives would be an easy (?) extention and increase coverage quite a bit.  And as long as I'm working on agreement, I might as well continue on to gender and count agreement: that's another things I couldn't really help but illustrate in most of my examples.

I'd like to discuss strategies for paring down overgeneration, but it's not really a problem at this point. :)
