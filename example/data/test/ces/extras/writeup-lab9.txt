Lab 9

***Things I changed ***

I fixed a couple of things for this lab.  Mostly things that weren't causing parse failures, but that were subtlely affecting the semantics.

1. Fixed coordination, which had never worked.  When I originally went through the customization system, I said that my conjunctions come before rather than after my coordinand.  That created rules that never worked correctly, so I went through the customization system a second time, chose the right answer, figured out what the differences were, and applied them to my working grammar.  It came down to changing all coordinations rules, such as:

n1-bottom-coord-rule := conj-last-bottom-coord-rule & n-bottom-coord-phrase &

to

n1-bottom-coord-rule := conj-first-bottom-coord-rule & n-bottom-coord-phrase &

I also had to have the coordination rule for S copy the non-coord daughter's INV value up, to reduce the duplicate analysis count.

2. Updated lots of PRED values.  I hadn't added the "_v_rel" stuff to most of my verbs, and had lots of spelling errors.  Added a few irules.

3. Fixed the problem where my clausal complement verbs weren't selecting for appropriate prop vs. ques complements.  There were a couple things wrong here: I wasn't identifying the SUBJ or COMPS value of my clausal complement verbs with the appropriate locations on ARG-ST, and they also weren't constraining the SF value on their complements.  I suspect it was just the second fix that really solved the problem, though I applied them in order so I can't be sure.

4. Changed my adjectives to inherit from basic-int-mod-adj-lex rather than basic-adjective-lex & intersective-mod-lex.  This was required to make the MRS match the forms generated in English and Italian.

5. Changed my OPT-CS value for optional-complement verbs to be type-id (for the same reason as above).

6. Added ten newt suite entries to exercise all combinations of tense and aspect.

***Transfer rules instantiated***

Just one: make-harm := make-harm-mtr.  This was to accomodate Italian's 'make harm' construction.  Everything else just worked.  I think it helped that Czech is an IE language, so there's weren't too many weird paraphrastic constructions to accomodate.

***Additional transfer rules developed***

None!

***MMT coverage, Italian***
13.5 out of 17 translate.  The .5 is for 'non me fa male' which translates oddly into Czech.

Notes:
* The embedded clause examples only worked if I set the maximum edge count to 16,000. :)  They also have the highest number of spurious translations.  
* I'm not sure why, but the Czech translations of the embedded clause and coordination examples seemed very promiscuous about word order, in ways that the simple sentences were not.
* The 'it doesn't hurt me' example translates in both cases to 'neškodí', which is just the verb (correctly negated and inflected).  But without the pronoun complement.  Maybe this is a case of pro-drop overextending?
* The "I can eat glass" example allows both the correct translation, and a version with the auxillary in the infinitive ("to be able to eat glass").  Not sure why that's happening, either.
* Many of the examples generate in the past as well as present tense.  But some don't, which is odd.

**Test suite performance***
* Tsdb reports 87.8% coverage.
* It also reports 1.51 average distinct analyses.  That's rather high, but a lot of that is genuine ambiguity.  A lot of my examples have 'chase cars' in them, and 'cars' in Czech is ambiguously singular or plural.
