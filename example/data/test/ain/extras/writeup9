1)Clean-up

1.Added [INFLECTED +] to modal-aux-lex to prevent prefix pronouns to be applied to modal-verbs.

2. Added more lexicons.
   - to sleep
mokor := intrans-sleep-verb-lex &
[ STEM < "mokor" >,
  SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_sleep_v_rel" ].
    
   - car (it actually means either boat or transportation)
cip := common-boat-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "cip" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_car_n_rel" ].

   - glass (Finally found it!)
tuki := common-glass-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "tuki" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_glass_n_rel" ].
 
   - to know
eraman := clausal-embed-prop-verb-lex &
  [ STEM < "eraman" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_know_v_rel" ].

   - hungry
iperusuy := adjective-lex &
  [ STEM < "iperusuy" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_hungry_a_rel"].

3. In semi.vpm, I added the following:

PNG.PER : PNG.PER
  first  <> 1st
  second <> 2nd
  third  <> 3rd
 *      <> !

E.TENSE : TENSE
   tense <> tense

PNG.PERNUM : PNG.PER PNG.NUM
1sing <> first sg
2sing <> second sg
3sing <> third sg
1plu <> first pl
1plu_incl <> first pl
1plu_excl <> first pl
2plu <> second pl
3plu <> third pl
*   >> ! !
!   << * *

4.Commented out pass-lex-rule as we don't implement passive now.

5.Changed the [ OPT-CS activ-or-more ] to type-id on prodrop-transitive-verb otherwise eat verb didn't work.

6.When prodrop is happening in the sentences like eci-kesanpa "I chase you" or somo en-arka "it doesn't hurt me",  prodrop-transitive-verb-lex with OPT-CS constraints didn't work. So changed the supertype of chase and hurt verbs from prodrop-transitive-verb-lex to regular-transitive-verb-lex as it is not constrained by OPT-CS.

7.Fixed both types of clausal-embed-verb-lex. Instead of constraining the SF value of complement, I used to constraint that of verbs itself.

8. Further, in addtion to 7, needed to change the constraints of SF on the comp-ques-lex and comp-prop-lex.

9.Added [ MC - ] for comp-prop-lex and comp-ques-lex so that they won't be attached at the end of the sentence.

10.In this-near-pl-determiner-lex, found a bug on 3sing->3plu  
this-near-pl-determiner-lex := demonstrative-determiner-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3plu ].

11.Changed the name of comp-ques-lex from ya to ya2 to diffrentiate it from the question marker ya.

 ya := qpart-lex-item &
  [ STEM < "ya" > ].

ya2 := comp-ques-lex &
  [ STEM < "ya" > ].


2) Transfer rules

Eng->Ainu

1. I needed pro-drop rule as Ainu can allow to omit both subject and object pronouns.

pro-drop := pronoun-delete-mtr.

2. Added a rule to transfer from exist_q_rel to exist_q_rel on demonstrative_a_rel as Ainu had unspec_q_rel on bare-np-phrase where English has exist_q_rel.


exist-unspec-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
 [ INPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
   OUTPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "unspec_q_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
    FILTER [ RELS < ! [ PRED demonstrative_a_rel,
              ARG1 #x] ! > ] ].


3.Added a rule to transfer from proximal+dem_a_rel to near+dem_a_rel on proximal+dem_a_rel in English because Ainu has near+dem_a_rel on the word, "these" and not proximal+dem_a_rel.

proximal-near-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
 [ INPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "proximal+dem_a_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
   OUTPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "near+dem_a_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
    FILTER [ RELS < ! [ PRED proximal+dem_a_rel,
              ARG1 #x] ! > ] ].


Ita->Ainu
1. Added a rule to transfer from exist_q_rel to exist_q_rel on demonstrative_a_rel as Ainu had unspec_q_rel on bare-np-phrase where English has exist_q_rel.


exist-unspec-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
 [ INPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
   OUTPUT [ RELS < ! [ PRED "unspec_q_rel",
		   ARG0 #x,
		   RSTR #harg ] ! > ],
    FILTER [ RELS < ! [ PRED demonstrative_a_rel,
              ARG1 #x] ! > ] ].

2.Added hurt := make-harm-mtr rule as Italian usage of hurt is different from Ainu.

3.More required transfer rules

1. I also wanted to develop a rule that can transfer the value on COG-ST as when they don't match on the verbs and prodrop occurs, it didn't translate properly. 
2. And the last rule I needed was from non-sg to pl. The sentence these dogs sleep didn't translate as I couldn't figure out how to match these 2 values.


4. Coverage

Eng->Ainu
16/17 sentences are translated.

Ita->Ainu
15/17 sentences are translated.

But still overgerating some setences by adding pesonal pronouns like e-, en-.

Overall more constraints are needed on:
a. adverbs being applied to S as well as VP.

b. personal pronouns as: 
   1pl-nom-prefix-lex-rule
   1sg-obj-prefix-lex-rule
   2-obj-prefix-lex-rule
   2sg-obj-prefix-lex-rule


5. Missing coverage

Eng->Ainu

1)These dogs sleep.

English had three non-sg and Ainu had three pl on these. I tried to match them thru semi.vpm or by changing the constraint value on the this-near-pl-determiner-lex from plu to 3plu to non3sg, I just couldn't figure out how to match these 2 values.
 
this-near-pl-determiner-lex := demonstrative-determiner-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3plu ].


Ita->Ainu

1)Same as above.
2)cani e gatti insegu-ono macchine "dogs and cats chase cars."
"and" has third non-sg in Italian where third plu for Ainu. 

3)Cani affamat-i mangi-ano "DO cats chase dogs?" 
It generated just a regular sentence, cats chase dogs and didn't add the question marker at the end to convert the sentence to a question.
