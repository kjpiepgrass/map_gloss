1)I found a bug in the lexicon.tdl.
For the overlapping coordination problem I mentioned in the previous lab was caused by the same numbering for both methods as follows:

wa_1 := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "wa" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "1" ].

ka_1 := conj-lex &
  [ STEM < "ka" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_and_coord_rel",
    CFORM "1" ].

So after I changed the 2nd rule to ka_2 and CFORM "2", both coordination examples were parsed correctly.

2)
I contacted the foundation for research and promotion of ainu culture and found someone who could help me to verify the grammaticality of the sentences I generated. Althought he is not a native speaker of Ainu, he has been working on this language for many years and he also publishes the only Ainu newspaper in Japan. He suggested some good reference books and explained the basic grammar of Ainu. It was extremely helpful and I made a correction to some of my sentences.

e.g.
cat
meeko -> cepa

seta meeko hospa.
 -> seta cepa kes-anpa.

"A dog chases (after) a cat."
