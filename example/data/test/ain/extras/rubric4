Notes

Please note the following instructions from the lab page, under "write up":

 2. Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated in your
 test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or the
 customization system. This will be most of the additions to your test
 suite this week. Here, too, please include IGT from your testsuite,
 and give explanations along the lines of the example above (though
 without the information about the customization system).

You have included IGT, but you have not included any descriptions
of the new phenomena.  

  1)Added plural demostratives.

This should be:  Demonstratives in Ainu inflect for number. 
They appear to the left of the nouns the modify.  (And it would
be nice to know how many different ones there are, and what
contrasts are marked.)

cat house place in to-be
`The cat is in the house.'

Is "place" required in this sentence?  Can "ta" appear without "or"
in other examples?

1sg-PRON girl COP
`I am a girl.'

What does the hyphen in ku-ne indicate?  Are there two morphemes there?

dog cat chase that 1sg-NOM think
`I think that the dog chases the cat.'

Can you also get the other 1sg pronoun in this sentence?  (at the
beginning?)

cat house place in to-be
`The cat is in the house.'

Maybe "an" is more like "exist"? That is, is it a locative verb?

eci kikkik.
ku-e kikkik
1sg-NOM 2sg-OBJ hit
`I hit you.'

The format of this example is off.  I think the gloss should be

1sg.NOM-2sg.OBJ 

assuming it corresponds to eci.

ku eci kikkik.

1sg-NOM 2sg-OBJ hit
`I hit you.'


Grammatical sentence?

  It could be because 2pl-OBJ is also eci so it might be misleading parser.

I responded to this hypothesis in my comments on a previous lab.
Please be sure to read them carefully, and ask questions if you would
like me to clarify anything.

There showed 24 parses for the following sentence.

pirka seta ka pirka cape ek.
pirka seta ka pirka cape ek
beautiful dog and beautiful cat come
`A beautiful dog and a beautiful cat come.'

This is because your type for adjectives is underconstrained.  But,
you weren't supposed to create a type for adjectives for lab 4, and there
are specific directions in lab 5.  If they don't make it clear how to fix this,
please post ot GoPost.

  I contacted the foundation for research and promotion of ainu
  culture and found someone who could help me to verify the
  grammaticality of the sentences I generated. Althought he is not a
  native speaker of Ainu, he has been working on this language for
  many years and he also publishes the only Ainu newspaper in
  Japan. He suggested some good reference books and explained the
  basic grammar of Ainu. It was extremely helpful and I made a
  correction to some of my sentences.

I'm very glad to hear this :)
