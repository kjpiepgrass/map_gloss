Notes:

You shouldn't need both of these:

3. In semi.vpm, I added the following:

PNG.PER : PNG.PER
  first  <> 1st
  second <> 2nd
  third  <> 3rd
 *      <> !

PNG.PERNUM : PNG.PER PNG.NUM
1sing <> first sg
2sing <> second sg
3sing <> third sg
1plu <> first pl
1plu_incl <> first pl
1plu_excl <> first pl
2plu <> second pl
3plu <> third pl
*   >> ! !
!   << * *

If your grammar has PERNUM, then only the second
one is appropriate.

  2. And the last rule I needed was from non-sg to pl. The sentence
  these dogs sleep didn't translate as I couldn't figure out how to
  match these 2 values.

This should be done by semi.vpm, and/or havnig non-sg as
a typen your grammar with pl as a subtype.
