This is lab 4, but your write up was hidden in a file
called lab3.

It is very helpful to me (as I try to get the grading done
efficiently and provide timely feedback) if you can organize
your write up to match the items requested, providing headings
for each.  Thanks.

 When filling out the web questionnaire, I selected erg/abs for
 case-marking, though there seems to be a special case-structure unique
 to (at least) Philippine languages that doesn't quite fit the normal
 paradigm.  This, combined with the fact that many of my sentences use
 the actor-focus forms of aspect markers, leads to a situation where
 those sentences aren't parsing.  Normally, in an erg/abs language, the
 agent in a transitive verb sentence would be in the ergative case.
 But the focus system allows for agent, patient, or goal to be
 "promoted" to the absolutive case.  Bearing this in mind, if I were to
 run the setup again, I might choose "verb-initial" rather than VSO for
 basic word order.

I'd like to you to consult with Scott (sfd@u) about how to analyze
this for Tagalog.  If the word order is fixed for any given 
form of the verb, verb-initial might not be the solution.  (When
an agent gets "promoted" to the so-called absolutive case, what
case does the patient appear in?  And what happens with
intransitives anyway?  What about verbs like "go"... are they
treated like agent-goal verbs, and do they take the goal-focus
form?)

 Sentential negation: I chose adverb as independent modifier of S.  It
 usually appears before, though negated matrix questions have it at the
 end.  

Interesting that the order is dependent on the sentential force.  I
think you'll want to negative adverbs. One is prehead ([POSTHEAD -]),
and constrains the INDEX.SF of its complement to prop.  The other
is posthead, and cosntrains the INDEX.SF of its complement to ques.

 I also filled out the coordination section, choosing
 Polysyndenton for all types, as a word following the coordinand.

A and B and C and?
A B and C and?

Maybe you word preceding the coordinand would be better.

 I probably should have skipped the matrix yes/no questions section
 given that the question particle is neither sentence initial nor
 sentence final.  But I felt compelled to fill out the entire
 questionnaire.

So what did you put in then, and how wrong is it?
