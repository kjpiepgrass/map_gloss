Your write ups would be easier to read if you used more
white space, esp. blank lines between items.

 3) For word-order, I chose SVO. It is the most frequently occurring
 word order, although all of my sources did have a more than a few
 examples of VSO.  I even found more than one sentence with VOS where
 was an inanimate subject

As we discussed in class, or somewhere, I think it's good to make
SVO basic, and then add a lexical inversion rule to get VSO (and 
something else possibly for VOS...).

 4) I said no to determiners.  I want to go with a definiteness marker
 that becomes a semantic agreement marker.  It makes more sense.  Even
 though we are not doing the copular sentences, the break in the
 definiteness agreement feels right for how these sentence work with a
 definite NP followed by an indefinite NP.

I think this is right, too.  

 5) I chose both adverb and inflectional.  The adverb is "ma" and
 precedes the verb.  The affix is "$" and attaches as a suxxix to the
 verb after all other affixes.  I gave the web form an s.  I making a
 note to change it later.  It is required for both the affix and the
 adverb to be present.

Cf the discussion on GoPost, and please follow up if you have more
questions.

   a) faTima is a proper name.  I chose a proper name because it
 doesnot take determiner, in the hopes that I would be able to end up with
 at least one grammatical sentence before I introduce Ddarija's
 agreement rules.

If they're not determiners, don't call them determiners.  Also,
nothing is stopping you from putting in full-form nouns for now
that have the definite article on them.  (And don't you have any
indefinites in your test suite?)

   e) My aux verb is "kan" which puts nominal sentences into the past
 or the future.  It can also be used to create compound or relative
 tense.  As an aside compound tenses can be created without using this
 verb or any auxiliary verb.\

How?

   a) I was expecting the grammar to let me separate the l from the
 noun by using a hyphen.  I had to separate it with a space.

If you add the hyphen to the list of *punctuation-characters* in
lkb/globals.lsp it will strip it for you.  But, you want to build
from the grammar start that is closer to the "truth" rather than
the one that has better coverage.

   c) The grammar hated me using '$' so much that when my grammar
 contained '$' as a transliteration character, no sentences would
 parse.  I looked for it *punctuation-characters* in the file
 lkb/globals.lsp, and I did not see it.  I changed it back to an s.  I
 need to find something, because 's' and 'h' appear together in a lot
 of prominent words and they do not become the dental-alveolar
 fricative 'sh'.

I need more info than this to debug.  You should be able to use
$ inside the value of STEM, but probably not as part of the instance
identifier for a lexical entry (the bit before :=).

      ii) I don't have prepositions, so I could not add any verbs that
 have a preposition as a verb particle.

What do you mean by "verb particle"?  It might be that you
have a series of homophonous forms, where one guise is a preposition
and the other is a particle...

   c) I'm not sure that changing the test suite is part of the current
 exercise, but I will add those sentences to the test suite as soon as
 possible

Don't add ungrammatical sentences to the test suite as grammatical
examples.

   e) The number of sentences is also equal to the number under the
 'Parses' column which I don't understand, since nothing is parsing
 from the test suite.

Answered on GoPost.  Let me know if you still have questions about this.

   I am glancing over the schedule for the rest of the quarter and I
 notice that we are not going to be covering adjectives or noun
 modification this quarter.  Most of the sentences that are testing
 agreement features in my test suite involve the use of adjectives.  I
 think I can remove all of those sentences. The only other agreement
 features in my grammar of Ddarija are on the verb.  As soon as I can
 get that agreement to work most of my sentences containing
 imperfective verbs should work.

Um, lab 5?

 I'm pretty certain that regardless of where I end up with this
 gramamr when this class is over, I will continue fleshing out this
 grammar for some time to come.

Cool :)

faTima := no-spr-noun-lex &
  [ STEM < "faTima" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_fatima_NP_rel" ].

_NP_rel is not one of the possible relation suffixes.
(And proper names are going to be handled differently, anyway.)

ka := subj-raise-aux-with-pred &
  [ STEM < "ka" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_indicative_v_rel" ].

That's a weird relation.  Perhaps this one shouldn't introduce
a relation at all?

One of the profiles you submitted is missing some of the parses ...
it has only 58.
