Lab 9 (Clean up & machine translation)
I.  Clean-up performed
    a) It turns out that I broke the compositional semantics of my grammar way back in Lab 6 when I
       implemented the demonstratives.  When I created the new noun-lex from the supertype I lost
       inheriting from no-hcons-lex-item.  
       It took me several days to figure that out.  Looking at the HCONS did not seem to help.  I
       got the failure point by going back through the edits to the grammar and catching the last
       version where the intransitive verb "neas(sleep)" had a good HCONS list.
    b) Even so, adding no-hcons-lex-item to the noun-lex type broke all my parses.  What I did
       was start with grammar six and add in all the relevant features up to the end of lab 8
       one feature at a time.  I would add a feature, test it to make sure that I still had a
       a good HCONS when I looked at a parses MRS and then add another feature.
    c) In this process I eliminated almost every boolean feature that I had created. They never
       did work the way I expected.  Adding two valued features to constrain the ordering
       of rule application is actually more elegant and works in a way that I understand.

II. Transfer rules instantiated.
    a) I instantiated the pro-drop rule for both English and Italian, 
       because Moroccan is a subject pro-drop language.  I was not sure if I needed to do it for Italain.
    b) I tried to instantiate the make-hurt rule for Italian, and for some reason I never
       saw it do anything. I tried both directions because hurt-> make harm and harm - > make hurt.

III.
    a) English.
       i) The following sentences did not transfer from English to Moroccan.
       	  In every case it was because of a mis-match in the MRS structure.
       	  1 - These dogs sleep.  
	    a: My demostrative adjectives are placing the tense and aspect information onto the 
	    demoinstrative.  I'm not sure how to fix this.  Now, I'm not even sure that I need 
	    demonstrative adjectives.  There are two sets of demonstratives.  One set attaches to the
	    following noun which must be marked definite.  It shows no gender or number agreement.
	    The other set shows number and gender agreement and for intenst and purposes functions
	    like a 3rd-person stand-alone pronoun.
	    For some reason yet to be determined, the Moroccan accepts teh Italian version of this sentences.
	  2 - I can eat glass.
	      I'm not sure.  It seems like the MRS structures are very similar. I think becasue of the
	      unspecified tense it might be running out of edges.  The LKB would start crashing pretty
	      regualrly once the 'out of edgges' error was generated.
	  3 - I think that you know that dogs chase cars.
	  4 - I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars.
	    For both of the see I can see that the verb argumet on the complemnet is not pointing to
	    anything. 
	  5 - Cats chase dogs and sleep.
	    On this one the MRS looks the same to me but the english has no aspect ionformation on
	    the coordination element.
	  6 - Chase the dog.
	    I never implemented the imperative.
       ii) Italian
       	   In general the Moroccan grammar generated more sentences from the Italian than from the English.  In the Italian
	   sentences not only were the verbs underspecified for tense but the nouns were 
	   underspecied for number.  Sentences with more than one noun generated all permutations of
	   the plural and singular nouns times the count of tenses on the verb.

	   The following sentences did not transfer from Italian.

	   1 - Posso mangi-are il vetro.  Same problem as English: my modal has broken MRS somewhere.

	   2 - Non mi-f-a male.  I created the rule in acm.mtr, but never it fires.  I ran out of
	   time. 

	   3 - Pens-o che sai che cani insegu-ono macchine
	   4 - Domand-o se sai che cani insegu-ono macchine
	     The MRS on my complemetizers is not correct.

	   I think the next three are that I am simply generating too many tenses and numbers.
	   Two of these three do transfer from English.
	   5 - Cani e gatti insegu-ono macchine
	   6 - Cani insegu-ono macchine e gatti insegu-ono cani
	   7 - Gatti insegu-ono cani e dorm-ono

	   8 - insegu-i il cane.  Same problem as English: I did not implement the imperative.
	   

IV  Final thoughts.
    I wish had had time to come in during office hours and get a hands-on walk through on fixing
the MRS on either my modal or my demonstratives.
