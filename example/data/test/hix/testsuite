#7 bad order intrans. This is an alternative word order used for intransitive sentences which may be valid. I don't see it that often, and when I do mostly with pronouns. I'll have to dig through the literature a little more.

#7 agreement ## All of the examples with pronouns, except for amna (which I didn't do for reasons I talked about in my writeup), need to be deleted. I think they're grammatical, but they're not natural and don't appear in the examples.  ## None of these examples have collective versions because that's encoded onto the tense, agreement suffix, which we haven't done yet.
