Notes

  And what the book says "The free form amna has been seen already to
  be unique among the +pro in two respsects: it has the same form for
  both individual and collective, and it obligiatoriyl cooccurs with
  the third person prefixes to express the category I+III. It is also
  unique in the rules which govern its position in the clause when it
  occurs as subject: 1) In quotative clause it always occurs
  immediately after the verb -ka- 'say' and 2) in all other finite
  clauses it occurs immediately before the V, even when there is also
  a free form direct object in the clause. This results in an order of
  constiuents that virtually never appears otherwoise, namely OSV"

Yes, this does seem a little over the top.  But I+III is an exclusive, right?
The word order we might not able to fully pin down, but the exclusive notion
we can certainly do.  I wonder what kinds of examples he tested to come
up with those word order generalizations.  It sounds suspiciously like he
might have had some sort of biased sample, to me.

  I'm not sure where they can attach actually which is why I didn't
  include an ungrammatical example. In the "singing loudly" example,
  loudly went before "singing" but singing was also a kind of
  denominalized phrase. For the purposes of this lab I think I will
  say they attach after the verb, but I don't have hard evidence to
  this fact, so I'm hesitant to put in "ungrammatical" examples.

It might be good to get his other book, too, if only in the hopes that
he'll have more examples.

This is example needs a translation line.

From your examples, it looks like you have obligatory agreement markers
and rampant pro-drop.

  "The foregoing examples higlight the structural differences in the
  two clause types. The equative nucleus has only nominals, in
  contrast with the copular complement, which must be a PP or an AP,
  the copula is present or absent, and the subject is an obligatory
  sonstituent of the equative, but not copular, clause"

Yikes!  Is this typical of his writing? Obviously not a paragon of clarity...

What is the internal structure of hitoniri, such that it is glossed as
his-going?

`I did not know that Wakara was going'

This one looks like it has two separate things going on in it:
The nominalization of going, and the not-knowing ... be
construction.  Are they independent?  (Or can you tell from your source?)

Do the nominalized verbs lose their agreement morphology,
or is the thing glossed as "his" actually a 3rd person subject marker?
(Btw, I find SIII etc *really* hard to read.  Can you search and replace
and switch to 3.subj or 3S or something like that?)


  Since we added a ton of items that aren't expected to parse yet,
  only some of my basic examples parse. Some of the more basic ones
  that should parse but aren't are because I have yet to put in my
  orthographic rules.

Still, I'm looking for a report on the percentages that are parsing
overall (such as you can get from Analyze | Coverage).

  I didn't really make any changes to the grammar other than put in
  some lexical items, and my previous tsdb suites were messy so I
  didn't compare. It looks like I may not be able to compare test
  suites with different numbers of items too?

You can, per the discussion in class today.  [incr tsdb()] does
an alignment based on the input strings (not the item numbers).
