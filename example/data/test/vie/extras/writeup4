This lab proved a bit of a challenge compared to the previous ones for several reasons,
mainly that all the features being examined this week are exhibited in Vietnamese, unlike
previous weeks where we could skip some, and for a lack of data. Most of the sources we
could find lacked explicit information that we needed, so many of these examples were 
constructed by us based on presumptions we made. If there was one good thing, it's that
the customization system cannot handle most of these phenomena, and thus saved us some work.


Matrix yes-no questions:

In general, for yes no questions in Vietnamese there are three different strategies. One
is simply by intonation in a declarative sentence. There is no way to display such a
distinction in text, so we don't have a test suite example for that. The next is placing
a negative construction after the verb, creating a "or not" type construction.

#71 The question is constructed as a positive-negative choice ("sleep or not sleep")
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Mai có ngủ không ngủ
Mai có ngủ không ngủ
Mai be sleep NEG sleep
"Does Mai sleep (or not sleep)?

This type of construction is usually accompanied by the auxiliary "be" verb "có", though
this is apparently optional in colloquial speech.

Often this construction will exhibit ellipsis, like in English, and drop the negative
construction's verb:

#72 The second instance of the verb in the positive-negative construction can be omitted ("sleep or not")
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Mai có ngủ không
Mai có ngủ không
Mai be sleep NEG
"Does Mai sleep (or not)?"

The third strategy is to use a special question particle, which functions similarly to a tag question
in English, requesting confirmation:

#80 There is a sentence final particle that indicates a desire for confirmation, similar to a tag question in English.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {q}
Mai ngủ chứ?
Mai ngủ chứ?
Mai sleep TAG.affirmation
"Mai sleeps, doesn't she?"

This particle is sentence final, and does not occur elsewhere. This was the only strategy that the
customization system is able to handle. We set the customization system to recognize a sentence
final particle.


Coordination:

Vietnamese seems to be rather free with its coordination. There is a class of conjunctions, from
which we selected a generic "and": và. NPs, VPs and sentences can all be coordinated. While
to be explicit, one can include conjunctions between all coordinands, in colloquial speech it seems
that it can be determined from context that adjacent constituents without conjunctions are coordinated
elements. Thus all the following constructions are valid:

#91 Three verb phrases can be coordinated with an explicit conjunction before the final coordinand

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {coordination}

tôi rửa mặt ăn phở và đọc sách
1SG wash face eat noodles and read book
"I wash my face, eat noodles, and read books."

#92 The conjunction can occur between all coordinands
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {coordination}
tôi rửa mặt và ăn phở và đọc sách

1SG wash face and eat noodle and read book
"I wash my face, eat noodles, and read books."

#93 Three verb phrases can be coordinated without an explicit conjunction
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {coordination}
tôi rửa mặt ăn phở đọc sách
tôi rửa mặt ăn phở đọc sách
1SG wash face eat noodles read book
"I wash my face, eat noodles, and read books."

In the customization system we selected NPs, VPs and sentences as coordinating. We were not able to
determine if bare nouns can coordinate inside NPs, for instance an English construction: 
[black [dogs and books]], so we left the bare nouns unchecked. It seems likely that modifiers do
not extend over multiple head nouns, so evidence points towards bare nouns not coordinating (if
they do coordinate, it's because they're treated as NPs).

The main restriction on coordination is that they must be of equivalent constituents, thus VPs cannot
coordinate with NPs:

#96 Non-equivalent constituents (such as a verb and noun) cannot be coordinated
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {coordination}
tôi ngủ và bánh mì
tôi ngủ và bánh#mì
1SG sleep and bread
*"I sleep and bread"

Coordination in the customization system caused one element to break from Lab 3, namely auxiliaries.
Because verbs can now be coordinated, the system incorrectly indicates that auxiliaries can also be
coordinated, leading to invalid constructions like this parsing:

#148 Auxiliaries cannot be coordinated
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {auxiliaries, coordination}
tôi cần cần ngủ
tôi cần cần ngủ
1SG need need sleep
*"I need to sleep"

It doesn't seem possible to fix this with the customization system, so we'll have to do it later.


Information structure:

Vietnamese has topic and focus markers that are typically used when specific emphasis is desired.
While seemingly similar, topic indicates what the statement is "about". It comes after the NP
and usually forces the NP to be the first in the sentence, even if it behaves as the object of the verb

#114 Indicating that the topic being spoken of is the speaker
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {info}
tôi thì đọc cuốn sách này
tôi thì đọc cuốn sách này
1SG TOP read book DEM.PROX
"I read this book"

#113 Indicating that the topic being spoken of is the book
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {info}
Cuốn sách này thì tôi đọc.
CLF.book book this TOP I read
"This is the book I read"

Focus is marked before the NP. It can occur before any NP in the sentence.

#118 Focus distinguishes a particular NP
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {info}
tôi thích cái con chó này
tôi thích cái con chó này
1SG like FOC CLF.animal dog DEM.PROX
"I like this very dog"

Note that both markers occur entirely outside of the NPs they mark, and thus constructions such as:

#121 The focus marker doesn't occur inside the NP
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {info}
tôi thích các cái con chó này
tôi thích các cái con chó này
1SG like all FOC CLF.animal dog DEM.PROX
*"I like these very dogs"

are invalid.

Obviously, since the customization system does not handle this concept, we could not make any changes
to it with regards to this, and these sentences do not parse.


Adjectives:

Vietnamese has no adjectives as we know them in English. The words that perform the attributive function
are "stative verbs". Being verbs, they can serve as sentence predicates by themselves. In an attributive
sense, they occur immediately after the noun they modify, with nothing able to occur inbetween. Note that
count nouns, when modified, require a classifier that comes immediately before the noun.

#103 An attributive "adjective" can fill the slot immediately to the right of the noun. In the case of count nouns, a classifier is required
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adjective}
tôi thích con chó đen
tôi thích con chó đen
1SG like CLF.animal dog black
"I like black dogs"

An "adjective" that has intervening components between it and the noun it modifies is most likely the predicate.

#109 If the "adjective" occurs on the outside of the demonstrative, and there is no other verb in the sentence, it is the main verb (predicate) of the sentence.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adjective}
con chó này đen
con chó này đen
CLF.animal dog DEM.PROX black
"This dog is black"

The customization system cannot handle attributive markers, nor classifiers, so these sentences do not parse.

As a side note, it does seem possible that in a classifier construction, the head noun of the NP is actually
the classifier, and the "regular" noun is a modifier for it, seeing as it seems to fit the modifier position
of the classifier. This is just speculation on my part, though.


Adverbs:

Adverbs are a tricky topic in Vietnamese, similar to determiners, as there are many different types, which
occur in different places. One type of adverb indicates "degree", such as "very". These seem to only occur
with stative verbs ("adjectives" in predicate position) and occur before the verb:

#139 Usually stative verbs are paired with adverbs of degree.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cop, adverb}
tôi rất cao
tôi rất cao
1SG very tall
"I am very tall"

Usually stative verbs in predicate position do not occur without these degree adverbs (while not strictly
ungrammatical, it sounds odd). Also, these adverbs do not occur with "action adverbs":

#141 These adverbs of degree only occur with stative verbs, not active verbs
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {cop, adverb}
tôi rất ngủ
tôi rất ngủ
1SG very sleep
*"I very sleep"

Some adverbs can occur either before or after the verb:

#124 Some adverbs may precede or follow the main (stative) verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adverbs}
Tôi thật cao
Tôi thật cao
1SG really tall
"I am really tall"

#125 Some adverbs may precede or follow the main (stative) verb
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adverbs}
Tôi cao thật
Tôi cao thật
1SG tall really
"I am really tall"

I am not sure what exactly is the difference between these two constructions semantically.

There are also manner verbs that only occur after action verbs:

#126 Manner adverbs follow the main verb. Seemingly by default it follows the object of the verb.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adverbs}
Tôi đọc sách nhanh chóng
Tôi đọc sách nhanh#chóng
1SG read book quickly
"I read books quickly"

There was a bit of confusion between us whether this adverb occurs between the object and the verb
or outside of them. It seems by default it occurs outside, but at least one source indicated that
it can occur between a modified NP object and the verb, but not a bare noun and the verb, meaning that
130 is grammatical and 129 is not:

#129 Adverbs do not seem to be able to appear between the verb and the a bare NP object
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {adverbs}
Tôi đọc nhanh chóng sách
Tôi đọc nhanh#chóng sách
1SG read quickly book
*"I read books quickly"

#130 One of our sources claims that manner adverbs can intervene between a verb and a modified NP object
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adverbs}
Tôi đọc nhanh chóng sách
Tôi đọc nhanh#chóng hai cuốn sách
1SG read quickly two CLF.book book
"I read two books quickly"

It was not too clear, but seemingly the difference is whether the V and the object can be considered
outside the confines of a VP construction or not.

These manner verbs cannot occur with stative verbs (and seems quite nonsensical in translation):

#111 Stative verbs cannot go with manner adverbs
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {adjective}
con chó này đen nhanh chóng
con chó này đen nhanh chóng
CLF.animal dog DEM.PROX black quickly
*"This dog is quickly black"

The customization system doesn't handle adverbs (or other modifiers), so these sentences do not parse.


Non-verbal predicates:

Non-verbal predicates only consist of NPs and PPs. These require the use of copulas, which assume the
place of the verb in the sentence. A nominal predicate without a copula is ungrammatical:

#134 A nominal predicate requires the use of the copulà 
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cop}
Tôi là gái
Tôi là gái
1SG COP girl
"I am a girl"

#135 A nominal predicate without the copula is ungrammatical
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {cop}
tôi gai
tôi gai
1SG girl
*"I am a girl"

Locative predicates use another special copula which carries the meaning of location:

#144 A special copula with a locative meaning occurs with locatives
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cop}
tôi ở Hà Nội
tôi ở Hà#Nội
1SG COP.LOC Hanoi
"I am in Hanoi"

At least one source seems to indicate that this copula is optional if there is another
word indicating location (such as a preposition), but we couldn't find clear examples of
how this is supposed to work.

Stative verbs cannot combine with the copula:

#142 The copula cannot be used with stative verbs
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {cop}
tôi là cao
tôi là cao
1SG COP tall
*"I am tall"

Copula are different from normal verbs in that they do not seem to deal with tense in the
same way. Rather than using tense markers, as normal verbs do, time is indicated with time
adverbials:

#147 Tense is not normally marked for copulas as other verbs are. Time adverbials are typically used instead.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {cop}
Hôm qua tôi sống ở Hà Nội
Hôm#qua tôi ở Hà#Nội
yesterday 1SG COP.LOC Hanoi
"Yesterday I was in Hanoi"

Again, the customization system cannot handle these constructions.


Embedded clauses:

Embedded clauses, clausal complements of verbs, make use of a complementizer. The complement
clause seems to be a fully fledged sentence, including tense markers and such:

#131 The sentence complement makes use of the complementizer rằng
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {emb-d}
Tôi nghĩ rằng Mai đã ngủ
Tôi nghĩ rằng Mai đã ngủ
1SG think COMP Mai PST sleep
"I think that Mai slept."

In most circumstances, the complementizer is optional, just as it is with English "that". The
verb is enough context to know that this is a complement clause, and not a separate coordinated
clause:

#132 The complementizer is optional, like "that" often is in English
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {emb-d}
Tôi nghĩ Mai đã ngủ
Tôi nghĩ Mai đã ngủ
1SG think Mai PST sleep
"I think Mai slept."

Embedded questions are no different from declaratives, and use the same complementizer:

#133 The same complemetizer can be used for embedded question clauses
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {emb-q}
Tôi hỏi rằng Mai đã ngủ
Tôi hỏi rằng Mai đã ngủ
1SG ask COMP Mai PST sleep
"I asked whether Mai slept."

In colloquial speech, the copula là is also sometimes used as a complementizer, and serves in
the same role as rằng.

As a side note, rằng actually originates from a verb meaning "say", but this usage is archaic, and
now usually only means the complementizer.

Given that the complementizer is optional, and with the argument optional nature of Vietnamese, we
couldn't think of a way to construct an ungrammatical construction with this (though there are probably
examples where the complementizer is not used, I could not determine what exactly defines this).


It seems we have a lot of work cut out for us in the coming weeks hand editing TDLs to accomodate
these features.
