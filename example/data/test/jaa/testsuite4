# Tense (cf. a:197, for gender agreement issues cf a:100)
# Gloss: IP immediate past, RP recent past, FP far past, e eyewitness, n non-eyewitness
# N.B. the verb does not inflect for gender in non-verb-final position (it occurs in feminine form when followed by affixes)
# N.B. tense suffixes always inflect for gender (whether they are verb-final or not)
# N.B. the vowels immediately preceding a tense suffix are sometimes changed and the initial /hV/ of a tense suffix is sometimes dropped, depending on morphophonological rules. These are reflected in our transliteration, but our morpheme-glossed lines regularizes the morphemes. (cf. e:128, a:196-8)
