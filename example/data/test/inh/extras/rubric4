Notes
-------------------------------------------------------

The clitic =’a (“and”) has the same distribution as =ji but is used when the coordinates do not form a group or are an incomplete or exemplifying listing. It implies VP or clause coordination instead or word or phrase coordination.

EB> This is an interesting contrast (between =ji and ='a), but I don't
understand what you mean by "implies VP or clause coordination instead
or word or phrase coordination."  In your example, ='a is attached
to the NP, not the VP.  Also, VPs (and clauses) are phrases.

The preposed particle je (“or”) has a similar distribution; it occurs before all of the coordinates or all but the first. It usually does not coordinate phrases.

EB> Again, what do you mean by "phrases"?  Also, I think it's fine to
limit the scope of your grammar to the and (not or or neither/nor)
coordination cases.

Embedded declarative clauses can also be formed with the conjunctions sanna or muo “like, as”.

EB> These converbs look like they might be functioning similar
to complementizers.  Do they inflect at all?


INFORMATION STRUCTURE
By default, topics in Ingush are in clause-initial position. Focus (of word or phrase) follows the topic but precedes the rest of the clause.


#42.15 Information Structure - Topicalization (& Focus) (correct)
# topic: Mista  focus: myshta

Mista xudar myshta duora?
Mista xudar myshta d-uo-ra?
sour porridge how D-make-IMPF
How did they make sour porridge? How was sour porridge made? (A traditional Ingush food.) 

EB> We're not going to handle "how", so you might want
to add an example here to replace this one.

EB> So no topic in this sentence?

1s.DAT=FOC nice day think, 2s.DAT how D-be.PRS know.PRS 1s.DAT
I don't know what you think, but I think it's a nice day.

EB> A simpler example would be good here, too.

Normal (unmarked) contrastive focus is also done by word order; it is immediately preverbal and not fronted.

EB> Why is this kind "normal"?

Cumulative focus is marked by the clitic =q.

EB> What is cumulative focus?

The compound verbs that are represented as one word are still not parsing correctly; this is because they need a hand-written rule in order to properly combine (since each part of the compound verb can take an explicit gender prefix).

EB> Can you post and example of this to GoPost so we can talk about it
in class tomorrow?  

EB> Lots of your attributive adjective examples are also
non-verbal predicate examples, which means they're not useful
yet.  I suggest augmenting with simple intransitive or transitive
sentences with adjectives inside the NPs.
