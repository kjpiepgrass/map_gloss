MATRIX YES-NO QUESTIONS
Ingush marks Yes-No questions with the clitic =ii on the verb.

This is the only way to mark such questions that we have found.




COORDINATION
Coordination is marked in several ways.
The clitic =ji (“and”) occurs on each word/phrase (usually words but also NPs and PPs). It is normally used for two items and exhaustive listings and implies word or phrase coordination. On longer lists or for emphasis it is optional on the last element. For the purposes of simplicity we are only modeling the first behavior and plan to add in the second behavior when we are modifying the rules directly, since the matrix does not allow for adding both and the first behavior appears to be more common.

A-ERG=& M-ERG=& write-D-VZ-NW.D letter
Ahmed and Mohamed wrote the/a letter (together).


The clitic =’a (“and”) has the same distribution as =ji but is used when the coordinates do not form a group or are an incomplete or exemplifying listing. It implies VP or clause coordination instead or word or phrase coordination.

Ahmed and Mohamed each wrote a letter.


The preposed particle je (“or”) has a similar distribution; it occurs before all of the coordinates or all but the first. It usually does not coordinate phrases.

ATTRIBUTIVE ADJECTIVES
Adjectives occur before the nouns they are modifying. Superlative and comparative forms are created with suffixes (though that is not covered in the current lab). Multiple adjectives can modify the same noun. In 1.4 further below in this section, “three” and “old” both count as adjectives. Numbers function as adjectives in Ingush.
Less than 10% agree with their nouns in gender.

EMBEDDED CLAUSES
Embedded interrogative clauses can be formed with several verbs, usually of speech or cognition. These take a finite complement and an interrogative word, which comes before the verb root and after any prefixes.

NON-VERBAL PREDICATES
Non-verbal predicates are allowed for nouns but do not seem to occur for any other class. We have an open question to our field linguist for more information on this. They behave like normal nouns for placement and marking, and are used with the neutral form of be.

INFORMATION STRUCTURE
By default, topics in Ingush are in clause-initial position. Focus (of word or phrase) follows the topic but precedes the rest of the clause.

Normal (unmarked) contrastive focus is also done by word order; it is immediately preverbal and not fronted.

Clefting is common in questions, but is not exclusive to them. In these cases the focus is on the interrogative word and the rest of the clause is nominalized. This is particularly common when the question word would be in an oblique case, or when the questioned word would be in nominative or ergative case.

Clefting in non-questions is triggered by focus. The focused word moves to the end of the clause and the rest of the clause (the verb and arguments) is nominalized.

Note that since most of the unmarked focus categories depend on word order they do not actually have negative examples; rearranging the nouns or verbs also rearranges focus.




ADDITIONAL NOTES
The only sections above that are covered by the grammar in addition to being in the test suite are coordination and yes-no questions.
We chose to represent clitics as affixes instead of entirely separate words, because clitics are two of the slots that can be filled for the various affixes that are attached to the verb and are not necessarily outermost.
The compound verbs that are represented as one word are still not parsing correctly; this is because they need a hand-written rule in order to properly combine (since each part of the compound verb can take an explicit gender prefix).
In order to improve accuracy we added many more stems to the lexicon and fixed some of the bugs that were discussed in the notes and in class (not properly restricting gender, not properly restricting singular vs plural). We also found a few typos and corrected these (correctly stemmed but with the wrong verb root, etc).
We also still have issues with the ‘ character; it is not being ignored as it should be, so some words and affixes are not properly parsing.
