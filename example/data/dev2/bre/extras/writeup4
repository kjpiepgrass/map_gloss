-------Coordination-------
Coordination in Breton seems to be very much like coordination in English or 
other Indo-European langauges. There is a freestanding word "ha" (or "hag" 
before vowels) meaning _and_ that appears between the two coordinands. We also
added the words for _or_ ("pe") and _nor_ ("na), since they appear to have 
the same behavior. We were unable to find any evidence with more than two
coordinands to see if the language strategy follows monosyndeton or 
polysyndeton, but are assuming that Breton is like most IE languages and uses
monosyndeton, requiring the coordinator to appear only before the last 
coordinand. However, we haven't put any examples with more than two in our test
suite, as we don't have any data as to the grammaticality of such constructions.

Here are some examples:

'I see you and you see me.'

In the customization system, we chose monosyndeton; then we said that there is
a word mark of coordination that appears before its coordinand and coordinates
nouns, noun phrases, verb phrases, and sentences. We did this three times, for
"ha", "pe", and "na" (and, or, nor).

-------Matrix Yes/No Questions-------
A yes/no question can be formed in Breton either through intonation alone or
by using a sentence-initial particle. There is a variation in the particle as
follows:
"ha" can be used before a positive statement
"daoust ha" is used before a negative statement
"daoust ha" can also be used before a positive statement, but this is emphatic
There is no other change to a statement than to put the particle at the 
beginning.

Here are some examples:

Ha debriñ ne-grez ket ur aval
Ha debr-iñ ne-grez ket ur aval
Q eat-INF NEG-do.2SG.PRS NEG a apple
'Aren't you eating an apple?'

In the customization system, we said that there is a sentence-initial particle
"ha" that is used in forming a question. Obviously, this does not capture all
the above data; there was no way in the customization to specify more than one
particle. As it stands, our grammar will not recognize the correct negative 
question, and it will accept the incorrect example where a negative is preceded
only by "ha" to form a question. We will fix this when we start editing the tdl
files.

2. Illustrated in test suite
-------Attributive adjectives-------
Generally adjectives follow the noun in Breton, but there are a few that don't.
Also, there are some cases (superlative, emphatic, pejorative) where the 
adjective precedes the noun.
All adjectives but one have a single stem for both plural and singular. We
aren't covering the one ("kaezh/keizh", _poor_) that does, since it is a unique
case. However, number, as well as gender, agrees with the noun by causing a 
mutation of the initial consonant of the adjective (but only when the adjective
follows the noun.) Specifically, feminine singular and masculine human plural
nouns cause the soft mutation on the adjective. In our transliteration, we are
removing mutations, because they are very extensive and there are lots of
exceptions, and generally it is a morphophonological process, although there 
are a few cases when it has a syntactic purpose, as here with the adjectives.
Instead of showing the mutation in our transliteration, we are adding a suffix,
attached to the adjective with a hyphen, that reflects number and gender. In
the cases where the human status of the noun is shown in the adjective mutation,
we are adding that as a suffix as well. (This only shows up in masculine plural
forms.) It wasn't in the Liepzig rules, but we are using "HUM" for it.

It is also worth noting that Breton prefers to use a noun as an adjective 
rather than a derived adjective form. We have one sentence in our test suite
with this usage.

-------Adverbs-------
Adverbs of manner can appear before or after a verb they modify. Adjectives
in this location can also be used as adverbs. When adjectives are used as 
adverbs, they can be preceded by the particle "e/ez" but it does not seem to
be necessary.

Here are some examples:

'The priest seeks a book quickly.'

-------Embedded clauses-------
I had a lot of trouble finding information about these types of embedded 
clauses, because none of the grammars mentioned this type of verb specifically.
Therefore, all the data I have is examples of correct usage, both from the 
sources and the web, which makes it difficult to come up with ungrammatical 
examples.

I looked for cases where there was the verb "gouzout", _know_, or "goulenn", 
_ask_ followed by a sentence. In all the cases that I found, the embedded
sentences were directly after the verb that licensed them, with no 
complementizer. In all the examples I found, the verb in the embedded sentence
was first; in other words, they seemed to follow VSO order. However, I hesitate
to say that anything else would be ungrammatical, because I just don't have 
data. It's a distinct possibility, though, and we will continue searching for
more definitive data about embedded S's. I found no difference between the way
sentences after _ask_ behaved compared to sentences after _know_.

-------Non-verbal predicates-------
The verb "bezañ", _be_, is used to form non-verbal predicates. The predicate can appear with "bezañ" in 
several orders, depending on information structure. One way the text mentions of doing it is to use "bez' e",
"bezañ" in a habitual form followed by the particle "e/ez", followed by a conjugated instance of "bezañ".

It's worth noting that "bezañ", when used as an auxiliary to a main verb, precedes the verb, but in most of
*these* cases, follows its subject. This isn't really a problem because in these sentences with non-verbal 
predicates, it's just a main verb "bezañ" that happens to be homophonous with the auxiliary.

-------Information structure-------
Breton handles emphasis and focus almost exclusively with word order. Our
text says "Basically, the new information (rheme) seems to come first in 
Breton. .. The known information (theme) seems to come after the rheme."
With the word order being V2, the sentence-initial position almost always 
carries some emphasis or the denotatin of new information. It is especially 
emphatic if the subject or object is filling that slot; using a subject pronoun
sentence-initially is even more so. Only one of our texts refers to the new
information, and basically treats it as if it's the same or nearly the same as
emphasis. The other texts all say that the sentence-initial position is 
emphatic.

This seems to happen within phrases as well; the adjective is normally found
after the noun, for most adjectives, but it appears that it can go in front of
the noun for emphasis.

Another emphasis marker that we show in the test suite is a verbal-suffix form
of the subject pronoun. This is the same as the freestanding subject pronoun,
except that Breton orthography attaches it to the verb with a hyphen (and 
presumably it is phonologically part of the verb, as well.) Using this suffix
is more emphatic than subject-dropping, which is allowed, but less so than 
using the freestanding subject pronoun at the front of the sentence.

There is also an emphatic position available for the object, and apparently not
the subject, that occurs in sentences with auxiliaries between the main verb
and the auxiliary.

3. Coverage over the test suite
Summary:
Total items: 148
Positive items: 75 of which 41 parsed, yielding 54.7% coverage
Negative items: 73 of which 7 parsed, yielding 9.6% overgeneration

Obviously a lot of sentences failed, because our test suite has many more phenomena than we have implemented
yet. Of our 148 sentences, 50 failed to parse because they had words that are not yet in our 
lexicon (adjectives, adverbs, the verbs of asking and knowing, and various particles.) 25 of these were
positive and 25 were negative (in other words, of the 34 positives that were incorrectly not licensed, only
9 were failures to parse something that the grammar should already have been able to do.) 

One of the false negatives:
Source: {author, Todd}
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: q
Ha gwelout a ra ar beleg al levr?
Ha gweliñ a-gr ar beleg al levr
Ha gwel-iñ a-gr ar beleg al levr
Q see-INF PRT-do.3SG.PRS the priest the book
'Does the priest see the book?'

This uses the question particle to form a matrix yes/no question. It generates a CP with all the words in
the sentence, but does not think that is able to be a sentence. I assume that the question particle is being
treated as a complementizer, but I don't understand why it wouldn't be willing to license an S with the 
structure it forms.

There are several sentences our grammar doesn't parse because our grammar is looking for a V2 order, but in
some cases Breton can have an order like this:  V O AUX S, or V S AUX O. Here's one of those:

# Grammatical object emphasis. Object must come after the verb if infinitive

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {info}

Debriñ a-gront belegoù ar un aval.
Debriñ a-gr-ont beleg-où ar un aval
eat.INF PRT-do-3PL.PRS the priest.M 
'The priests are eating an apple.'

The grammar also failed to parse the sentence with a noun used as an adjective, which is hardly surprising:

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: adj
Klask a ra ar belegoù ul levr liorzh.

Klask-iñ a-gr ar beleg-où ul levr liorzh
seek-INF PRT-do.3SG.PRS the priest-PL a book garden
'The priests are seeking a book about gardens.'

The last failure to parse a grammatical sentence was with "be" as a main verb; really that should go in the 
list of ones that fail to parse because we don't have their entry in the lexicon yet.

Of the false positives (our areas of overgeneration), two examples of verb-subject disagreement are getting
through, here is one:
Source: {author, Todd}
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: {agr}
Debriñ a ra ar beleien un aval.
Debriñ a-gr ar belegoù un aval.
Debriñ a-gr ar beleg-où un aval
eat.INF PRT-do.3SG.PRS the priest.M-PL an apple.M.SG
'The priests are eating an apple.'

The verb is in a 3rd person singular form, but the subject is in a singular form. I think this is happening
because of the V2 word order in the customization; Breton generally puts the subject before the object unless
the object is being emphasized. So in this example, _apple_ is being treated as the grammatical subject.

Here's another incorrect generation:
# be goes before its complement

Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: wo
Kanañ a vezan.
Kaniñ a-bezan
Kan-iñ a-bezan
sing-INF PRT-be.1SG.HBT.PRS
'I usually sing.'

This happens because our auxiliaries are listed as coming after their complement; however, bezañ has the 
opposite order. This example is generated if we reverse that rule in the choices file.

Two examples are being generated although they have a coordinator as the last word in the sentence.
This has the same spelling as our question particle, but since the question particle comes sentence-
initially, I still can't quite figure out why it would be okay with a coordinand or Q particle happening at
the end.

One was generated although it did not have a correct particle before the verb to put it into present 
progressive form:
# need the particle "o" to make present progressive

Eñ a emañ cchoarzhiñ.
Eñ a-emañ cchoarzhiñ

"He is laughing."

This is because we haven't actually gotten the present progressive form correct yet. It is the preverbal
particle "o" + verb.INF. However, right now our grammar accepts the infinitive form as a present progressive
because we haven't figured out how to require the preverbal particle for that particular form.

We also license as grammatical a sentence that is attempting the demonstrative _that_ and doesn't have the 
correct article preceding the noun. As far as I know, we don't have a way through the customization system
to tell it that if a noun has a certain suffix, it requires a certain determiner.

4. We changed the punctual forms of _be_ to require a present participle. We think this is required, and can
only find examples of these forms followed by a present participle, but we have no negative data to tell us
if that is the only form that can be used. However, it seems that the punctual forms are used pretty
specifically this way.

The sentence that was overgenerated was this:

We realized that since _be_ was accepting all nonfinite forms, that of course this would be allowed.
The change we made did not actually improve our performance, because of the reasons listed above in the 
discussion of the false positive we get with that sentence.
