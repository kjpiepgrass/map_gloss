Notes
-------------------------------------------------------

  In the customization system, we chose monosyndeton; then we said
  that there is a word mark of coordination that appears before its
  coordinand and coordinates nouns, noun phrases, verb phrases, and
  sentences. We did this three times, for "ha", "pe", and "na" (and,
  or, nor).

The customzation system has given you a grammar where these
all mean "and".  You need to edit the tdl to make "pe" introduce
_or_coord_rel, and the rules that go with "pe" to do the same.  I think
"nor" is probably a negative polarity item, and therefore outside the scope.

  In the customization system, we said that there is a
  sentence-initial particle "ha" that is used in forming a
  question. Obviously, this does not capture all the above data; there
  was no way in the customization to specify more than one
  particle. As it stands, our grammar will not recognize the correct
  negative question, and it will accept the incorrect example where a
  negative is preceded only by "ha" to form a question. We will fix
  this when we start editing the tdl files.

You can add the other particle in tdl like this:

daoust-ha := qpart-lex-item &
  [ STEM < "daoust-ha" > ].

... or if you want to change the spelling to leave the white space,
you should even be able to do this:

daoust-ha := qpart-lex-item &
  [ STEM < "daoust", "ha" > ].

  It is also worth noting that Breton prefers to use a noun as an
  adjective rather than a derived adjective form. We have one sentence
  in our test suite with this usage.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  Are you talking about a particular
class of nouns/adjectives, or more generally? 

  All adjectives but one have a single stem for both plural and
  singular. We aren't covering the one ("kaezh/keizh", _poor_) that
  does, since it is a unique case. However, number, as well as gender,
  agrees with the noun by causing a mutation of the initial consonant
  of the adjective (but only when the adjective follows the noun.)
  Specifically, feminine singular and masculine human plural nouns
  cause the soft mutation on the adjective. In our transliteration, we
  are removing mutations, because they are very extensive and there
  are lots of exceptions, and generally it is a morphophonological
  process, although there are a few cases when it has a syntactic
  purpose, as here with the adjectives.  Instead of showing the
  mutation in our transliteration, we are adding a suffix, attached to
  the adjective with a hyphen, that reflects number and gender. In the
  cases where the human status of the noun is shown in the adjective
  mutation, we are adding that as a suffix as well. (This only shows
  up in masculine plural forms.) It wasn't in the Liepzig rules, but
  we are using "HUM" for it.

If the mutation is at the start of the word, it might make more
sense to model it as a prefix :)

Is this a compound noun structure?  (Note that the English translation
doesn't use an adjective either!)   This class of examples probably isn't
relevant for the space of phenomena we'll be exploring.

  Adverbs of manner can appear before or after a verb they
  modify. Adjectives in this location can also be used as
  adverbs. When adjectives are used as adverbs, they can be preceded
  by the particle "e/ez" but it does not seem to be necessary.

The two examples you give show the adverb attaching to the left
or to the right of the *sentence*, which is different than attaching
to the left or to the right of the *verb*.

  I had a lot of trouble finding information about these types of
  embedded clauses, because none of the grammars mentioned this type
  of verb specifically.  Therefore, all the data I have is examples of
  correct usage, both from the sources and the web, which makes it
  difficult to come up with ungrammatical examples.

I think it's fantastic that you're finding data from the web.  How are
you doing this?  

How about examples of non-verbal predicates that lack the
copula (as ungrammatical examples)?

What happens for PP predicates (He is in the park)?
