=== 1. Changes to choices file ===

The changes to the choices file were relatively minor this time around.
We changed the behavior of the determiners/demonstratives to better reflect the phenomena in the language.
We added coordination between NPs.  This is done with a polysyndeton coordination scheme, with a word that precedes the coordinand.
Examples:

#118
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {crd}
Pronoun must come first
x̣ʷil̕ ti č̓ač̓as ʔi čad
x̣ʷil̕ t-i č̓ač̓as ʔi č-ad
get.lost det.def-dir child and ind.pred-I
'the child and I get lost'

We added adverbs. Because they function like auxiliaries, we were able to put them in the customization system.
Examples:

#135

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adv}
ck̕ʷáqid ti č̓ač̓as ?ux̣ʷil̕
ck̕ʷáqid t-i č̓ač̓as x̣ʷil̕
always det.def-dir child get.lost
'the child always gets lost'

=== 2. Properties exclusively in Test suite ===

Matrix yes/no questions are formed in Lushootseed by adding a question particle whose position varies according to the sentence structure.  If the subject has raised past the verb, the particle goes after the subject, and if the subject has not raised, it goes after the subject.  The particle can also go at the end of the sentence to make a question such as "It is really you, isn't it?"

Attributive adjectives are very simple in Lushootseed.  They always immediately precede the noun, and show no agreement morphology.
Examples:

#132
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adj}
ʔik̕ʷid čad ti hìkʷ ʔalʔəl
ʔik̕ʷid č-ad t-i hìkʷ ʔalʔəl
sweep ind.pred-I det.def-dir big house
'I sweep the big house'

Embedded clauses are likewise simple.  The embedded clause is a normal S, except that the particles used in it do not have the independent predication marker, and the third-person particle is admissable.
Examples:

Non-verbal predicates are formed by placing a subject after a noun or adjective.  The subject may be dropped if it is third person, and the noun/adjective can take the past/future markers.
Examples:

Judgment: g

There are several interesting information structure phenomena.
First, adverbs can be moved to the end of the sentence to emphasize them.

#155
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo,info}
x̣ʷil ti č̓ač̓as ck̕ʷáqid̕
x̣ʷil̕ t-i č̓ač̓as ck̕ʷáqid
det.def-dir child get.lost always
'the child \emph{always} gets lost'

The second is the system of pronouns.  If a pronoun subject (not a particle) occurs before the verb, then it changes the meaning of the sentence to emphasize the pronoun.

#156
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {pn,info}
ʔəcá x̣ʷil̕
ʔəcá x̣ʷil̕
I get.lost
'It is I that gets lost'

Finally, in passive constructions (which only occur with transitive verbs), the order of the arguments determines which has focus, and the subject is marked with a preposition.  Whichever argument appears first has focus.

Phenomena: {wo,info}

'the house is swept by the child'

=== 3. Coverage ===

All of the examples whose phenomena we have implemented parse.  There are a handful of incorrect sentences that do parse, due to not restricting verbs to only a single full NP argument.

=== 4. Limitations of Customization System ===

Our interrogative particle is neither sentence initial or sentence final, so we have not implemented matrix yes/no questions.
We have not been able to restrict transitive verbs to only one full NP with the customization system.
The S coordination pattern in Lushootseed is not marked with an independent word, so we cannot implement it with the Matrix.  The word order changes that result are also not implementable.
Adjectives and non-verbal predicates are not included in the Matrix, so we have yet to implement them.
Passives require the use of prepositional phrases, so they are not implementable with the Matrix.
The word-order change with pronouns that occurs in order to focus the pronoun will require a new phrase-structure rule, so we cannot implement it yet.
