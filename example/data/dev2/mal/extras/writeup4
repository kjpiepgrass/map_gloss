Delimeters 
	I specified that Malayalam does have delimeters, although they are never required.
	The term 'oru' can be used to change a noun to an indefinite form.
	Oru is optional on all nouns.
	
Sentential Negation
	There are 2 different negative forms of 'be' which can be used to negate
	a sentence.  There are also 2 suffixes which can be added to verbs to 
	negate the sentence.
	
	I entered one of the verb suffixes, alla.  I'll need to refine rules to
	allow the other cases.
	
Coordination
	My test cases both illustrate coordination of nouns - subject in one case, 
	and object in the other.
	(Coordination in Malayalam is more complex, but I will stick to NPs for now.)
	
	I chose a coordination system which is N-polysyndeton, in which nouns are
	marked by the suffix -um after each ccordinand.

Matrix yes-no questions
	I chose that Malayalam has a separate question particle, -oo, which is
	sentence final.
	There are cases where the suffix is added to verbs which are not sentence
	final, so the rules may need to be revised for other cases.
	
# Document what happened when you tried parsing a sentence with your starter 
grammar. Did it parse? Did it return the expect structures? If it didn't parse 
or didn't return the expected structures, why not? 
(That is, what can you find out about why not?)

The sentence with my starter grammar was "kutatai ammaye vilaiccu"
It parsed just fine!
It was interesting to see the tree drawn in the Malayalam sentence order, with 
the verb at the end of the sentence, and therefor at the right side of the 
branches.  Not like the HPSG trees for English, so it took me a minute to 
realize it was fine.

# Document the current coverage/overgeneration of your grammar on your test 
suite, per [incr tsdb()], before and after you expanded the vocabulary.

	Unfortunately, despite many hours and downloads of various programs, 
	I can't run tsdb yet. I had it working in the office, but from home 
	I can't get the linux environment to connect to the internet.
	
	knoppix fails to find an x-driver, so crashes.
	Xwindows can't find a font driver, so won't open.
	Parallels (linux VM) is running, but won't connect to the internet.
	
	I was able to run lkb and tsbd at the office with Parallels, 
	so at least I've verified that I have it installed, and it does run :-}

	I created a batch file from all my test sentences, and ran them
	with the LKB.  The output from my initial set is test_suite_out1.txt
	The last set of results I have are test_suite_out2.txt
	
	

# In about a page, discuss which phenomena will give you the biggest bang for 
the buck in terms of improving coverage/overgeneration over your test suite. 
I.e., consider things that occur in many of your sentences. Are there any 
phenomena which are unnecessarily complicating your test suite? That is, are 
you inspired to simplify any of your sentences to have them illustrate fewer 
phenomena at a time? 

The biggest problems with coverage/overgeneration seem to be occurring with
the rules regarding case, and coordination.  I also need to add more word 
types to allow some of my more complex sentences.  
	There doesn't seem to be any limits on the cases allowed for subject and 
object nouns.  (Of course with flexible word order, those rules will be 
difficult.) Perhaps some rules could be written to prevent both nouns from 
being ACC, or requiring al least one NOM noun in a sentence?  It seems that
all sentences which have a noun have at least one noun in nominative form 
with the exception of sentences with modals, in which case the subject is
in dative form.
	Coordination is not working very well and could be improved.  The rules 
are working to add the coordinating suffix to nouns and not to verbs, thank 
goodness.  However, the rules currently overgenerate because there doesn't
seem to be a requirement that both nouns have a coordinating suffix. The 
rules allow only one noun to have the suffix. Of course I have a more 
complicated case in which there are multiple sets of coordinating 
subject/object pairs with a single verb which applies to all the pairs. 
A saw B and C saw D is written as: A B-um C D-um saw.  
	There are a few word types which I would like to add.  Adverbs such as now, 
and adjectives such as good occur in some of my sentences, but there are not 
types for these yet.  I also have a few sentences with specifiers like 'this' 
so rules for those words would be helpful in completing my tests.
	One area where I can simplify my test cases is to use fewer different 
words.  I used many different names, following the sentences I found in
the book, and many different verbs which don't necessarily add information
about the grammar.  As I get a feel for the language, I might be able
to reduce the vocabulary.
