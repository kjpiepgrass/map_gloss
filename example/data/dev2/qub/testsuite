# MWG: Not all examples had all 4 lines, so I created the orth tier from the
# orth-seg tier where needed.


####################################################################################
#NOTE:
#
#LAB3 NEW EXAMPLES START from #88. 
#
#PLEASE NOTE THAT THAT I WAS GLOSSING THE SUFFIXES WRONG IN LAB 2.
#AS I WROTE IN THE WRITE-UP, QUECHUA SUFFIXES ENCODES 
#THE PERSON OF THE SUBJECT AND OBJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY ALONG WITH TENSE,
# SO I CORRECTED THE EXAMPLES I HAD IN THE LAST LAB. 
#THE SYMBOL 'X>Y' IS USED TO INDICATE THE PERSON OF THE SUBJECT (X) AND 
# THE PERSON OF THE OBJECT (Y). INTRANSITIVES DO NOT TAKE ANY OBJECT, SO 
# ONLY THE PERSON OF THE SUBJECT IS INDICATED. 1 = FIRST PERSON, 2 = SECOND PERSON,
# 3 = THIRD PERSON.
