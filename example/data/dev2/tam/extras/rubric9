-----------------------------------------------------
Notes:
 
  The lab 8 feedback noted that the HCONS for embedded clauses was
  not.  The ARG2 of the main verb was not qeq to the label of the
  other verb.  In searching for the cause, I found that my
  clausal-verb-lex did not include this relationship.  I modified the
  type to establish this relationship.  The new type definition is
  given below.


clausal-verb-lex := main-verb-lex & clausal-second-arg-trans-lex-item &
    [SYNSEM[LOCAL.CONT[HOOK.INDEX.SF prop-or-ques,
                       HCONS <!qeq & 
		                [ HARG #arg2,
		                  LARG #ltop ] !>],
            LKEYS.KEYREL.ARG2 #arg2], 
     SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS<[LOCAL.CAT.MC -, 
                                 LOCAL.CAT.VAL[COMPS<>, SUBJ <>],
                                 LOCAL.CONT.HOOK[LTOP #ltop, INDEX.SF prop-or-ques]]>].

The supertype already has the qeq:

clausal-second-arg-trans-lex-item := basic-two-arg &
   [ ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX ref-ind & #ind ],
	      [ LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.LTOP #larg ] >,
     SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CONT.HCONS <! qeq & [ HARG #harg,
					  LARG #larg ] !>,
	      LKEYS.KEYREL [ ARG1 #ind,
			     ARG2 #harg ] ] ].

What was missing was a link between ARG-ST and COMPS.
 
  I also had to add a constraint so that embedded clauses were not
  able to combine via the head-subj and subj-head rules.

head-subj-phrase := decl-head-subj-phrase & head-initial-head-nexus &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.MC #mc,
    HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM [LOCAL.CAT[MC #mc, HEAD.HF -], VERB-CL +] ].

That's also surprising. Something was allowing a clausal subject?

In general, this was excellent, as usual!
