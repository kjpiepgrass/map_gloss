################################################################################
# The format of the lines for each sentence in the test suite is:
#
# - standard orthography
# - regularized morpheme to morpheme delimited
# - morpheme to morpheme gloss
# - free translation
#
# The orthography may be inaccurate in the sentences not sourced from 
# Valentine, 2001. These sentences have been created by non-native-speakers 
# of Nishnaabemwin to demonstrate syntax features of the language and have 
# not been vetted by native speakers.
# 
# Valentine, 2001 uses bold and hyphens to highlight morphemes that are
# being discussed, they have been removed for the standard orthography of
# the test suite.
#
# The morpheme used in the regularized morpheme to morpheme gloss are
# interpreted from noun and verb inflection paradigms and prefix/suffix 
# pattern charts in Valentine, 2001. Where there was no information, a best
# guess was made based on Valentine's explanation of the morphophonology of
# Nishnaabemwin.
#
# Where Valentine uses variations of words or morphemes based on community
# dialects in the orthography, these words or morphemes are mapped in the
# regularized morpheme to morpheme line with a single representation from
# the lexicon, which encodes only one version and considers it canonical.
# The comments for these sentences will call this out.
#
# In the morpheme to morpheme gloss, the following symbols are used:
#
#   -  a hyphen delimits morphemes and should line up one for one with the
#      regularized morpheme to morpheme line that precedes it.
#
#   +  a plus sign delimits the words in an English multi-word translation
#      of a Nishnaabemwin word in the regularized morpheme to morpheme line
#      that precedes it.
#
#   .  a period delimits a word or morpheme from its gloss
#
#   Nishnaabemwin Grammar abbreviations used in the gloss and comments:
#
#   vii   verb intransitive inanimate subject
#   vai   verb intransitive animate subject
#   vti   verb transitive inanimate object
#   vta   verb transitive animate object
#
#   AN    animate 
#   IN    inanimate
#
#   OBV   obviate
#   PROX  proximate
#
#   AC    Actor
#   GL    Goal
#
#   THM   theme
#   INV   inverse
#   DIR   direct

#### Word Order - Grammatical (Nishnaabemwin is free order) - wo

# Source refers to this example as desiderative, no other examples 
# of desiderative are provided in the text. Q: what are the implications 
# of inflection in this sentence, does future imply 'needs' when the subject
# is inanimate?
