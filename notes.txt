Fix inference to extend beyond TAM:
    GOAL: allow inference of many linguistic structures and evaluate by structure (tense, aspect, mood, case, gender, etc.)

Fix eval_infer.py:
   - set containers in model.py
   - load choices using Choices but from model.py
   - once a choice has been found, using the ftype, send to each container's ftype as (dataset, language, category, choice)
